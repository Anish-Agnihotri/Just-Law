MCWATT, J.:
COSTS RULING
Introduction

[1]
The parties both brought motions on February 28, 2017. The respondent wasunsuccessful on his Motion to Change the Order of Perkins J., dated March 30, 2012. Theapplicant was successful on her motion to have income imputed to the respondent and change thechild and spousal support orders that had previously been put in place by Justice Perkins.

[2]
The City of Toronto, Legal Services, also took part in the motion by virtue of anassignment by the applicant of arrears owed to the City from payment of social assistance to herfrom November 1, 2014 to January 1, 2017. By the dismissal of the respondent’s motion, theCity has achieved success in maintaining its stated interest of $17,361.

[3]
The Applicant asks for costs on a full recovery basis in the total amount of $76,360.87,consisting of fees of $65,917.50 ($54,907.50 + $11,010), disbursements of $1,658.49 and HST
of $8,784.88 ($7,353.58 + $1,431.30). In the alternative, she asks for costs on a partial recoverybasis in the amount of $50,398.17.

[4]

The City has asked for its costs of the motion in the amount of $7,000.

[5]
The respondent’s Costs submissions were delivered late. He brought a 14B Motion toextend the time for filing those submissions. I have granted the motion and accepted his replysubmissions for costs on the motion.

ONTARIO

[6]
The respondent did not reply at all to the City’s submissions as to costs. In thecircumstances, he should pay part of those costs. The applicant was forced to go on publicassistance from the municipal government partly due to the respondent’s non-payment ofsupport. The City has acted appropriately in this matter and its costs are fair and reasonable. Thehourly rate of $400 per hour charged by counsel for the City is fit, taking into consideration Ms.Smith’s year of call to the Bar of 1991. This issue was not a difficult one for the City, but itsucceeded in retaining its entire interest in the money owed to it by the applicant, Ms. Sickinger.

[7]
The respondent is ordered to pay $5,000 in costs, including disbursements and HST, tothe City of Toronto within 90 days of the date of this endorsement.
Costs to the Applicant

[8]
The applicant asks for costs on a full recovery basis, payable within thirty days andenforceable as support. In the alternative, she asks for recovery of 66% of her costs, representingcosts on a partial recovery basis. She asks for costs on a full recovery basis, pursuant to Rules 18
and 24 of the Family Law Rules, for the following reasons:
a. she was entirely successful on the motions;b. the issues were important, involving the parties' imputed incomes, allegedmaterial changes in circumstances, the respondent's retroactive and ongoing childand spousal support obligations, including his requested termination thereof, andcredits requested by the respondent. The respondent sought to eliminate hissubstantial arrears of support, found by me to be in the amount of $83,544. Theoutcome of the motion was critical to the applicant, who is on social assistance,and who has failed to achieve self-sufficiency in light of the respondent's nonpayment of support. The issues were all highly contested;c. the applicant was reasonable in her litigation conduct throughout. She made twooffers to settle the motion to change, dated August 5, 2016 and February 27, 2017,respectively.
She withdrew the former offer only on February 10, 2017, whenshe learned that Roto-Gro International Limited ("Roto-Gro") had officially listedon the Australian Securities Exchange that day; andd. the respondent acted unreasonably in this litigation:
i.
He failed to produce key financial information, which forced me to drawan adverse inference against his credibility. The respondent did notdisclose his 2014 and 2015 Income Tax Returns or his 2015 Notice ofAssessment. He did not disclose his true income as of June, 2016 of
$158,160 from Roto-Gro, plus reimbursement of all reasonable expenses,which was more than double the income imputed to him by the FinalOrder dated March 30, 2012 of Justice Perkins. He did not disclose theFebruary 10, 2017 Roto-Gro listing on the Australian Securities Exchange;

The financial disclosure that the respondent did make was misleading,indicating an absence of actual income and a potential imminent furtherbankruptcy;He has shown a disregard for Court Orders. He failed to comply with hissupport obligations, such that various judges of this Court threatened tostrike his motion. He disobeyed costs and other Orders. The respondentmet his obligations in December 2016 so his motion would not be struck.
Notwithstanding the clear and unambiguous "one final, peremptoryopportunity" language of Justice Glustein' s Order, dated December 22,2016, the respondent brought a Form 14B motion, asking for permissionto file additional numerous, voluminous affidavits, which became apreliminary issue at the hearing of this motion to change. That motion wasdismissed;He attempted to re-litigate the issues that had been decided by JusticePerkins in the Final Order;He failed to accept the applicant's offer to settle dated August 5, 2016
even when he most likely knew the truth of his Roto-Gro income (and theapplicant did not). The terms of that offer were severable and he couldhave accepted the offer in part, thereby narrowing the scope of theoutstanding issues and reducing costs, but he did not;He did not serve a formal offer to settle, but did send an email afterbusiness hours the night before the hearing proposing terms of settlement.
He was not successful in achieving any of those proposed terms;The respondent was not successful on any of his claims;

e. The position that the applicant took in her Response to Motion to Change, prior toMs. Kerr's involvement, was successful. The applicant dedicated many hours tothe proceeding. Answering the applicant's ongoing demands for financialdisclosure was time consuming. The work that the applicant did on her owndirectly correlated to the motion result;f.

Ms. Kerr's hourly rate is reasonable, having regard to her year of call andexperience;

g. The final result of the motion is more favourable to the applicant than the terms ofher offers to settle, as follows:
a. The applicant was prepared to accept child support ranging from $468 permonth to $539 per month in her first offer, and ranging from $468 per monthto $750 per month in her Rule 18 offer. The child support ordered ranges from
$468 per month to $1,264 per month;b. The applicant was silent on Thomas' medical expenses in both of her offers.
For the period December 19, 2014 through May 2016, my Endorsementrequires the respondent to pay the applicant 83% of Thomas' medicalexpenses in the annual amount of $10,850;

c. The applicant was prepared to accept spousal support ranging from $1,200 permonth to $900 per month in her first offer, and of $968 per month in her Rule18 offer. The spousal support ordered ranges from $968 per month to $3,698
per month;d. The applicant offered a credit on account of the child support arrears of
$7,500 in her Rule 18 offer. No credit is provided for in the Endorsement; ande. Both offers provided an opportunity for acceptance within which the partieswould pay their own costs. Acceptance after that timeframe meant that costswould be as determined by this court.
The Law

[9]
Costs are governed by Rule 24 of the Family Law Rules. Rule 24(1) confirms that asuccessful party is presumed to be entitled to her costs. Under Rule 24(5), the court can considera party's behaviour in relation to the issues from the time they arose, including whether a partymade an offer to settle or any offer a party failed to accept when deciding whether a party hasbehaved reasonably or unreasonably.

[10] Offers to settle are important to the possible resolution of cases. They are important todetermining costs. In deciding whether a party has acted reasonably or unreasonably in a case,the court shall examine the reasonableness of any offer the party made. Offers to settle aresignificant in determining both liability for costs and quantum (L.NA. v. G.F.A, [2014] No. 5272
(O.C.J), paras. 31 to 33 and 37 to 38).

[11] Modern costs rules are designed to foster three fundamental purposes: 1) to partiallyindemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation; 2) to encourage settlement; and 3) todiscourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants (Serra v. Serra, [2009] O.J. No.
1905 (C.A.), para. 8).

[12] The preferable approach in family law cases is to have cost recovery generally approachfull recovery, so long as the successful party has behaved reasonably and the costs claimed areproportional to the issues and the result (Biant v. Sagoo, [2001] O.J No. 3693 (S.C.J), para. 20)
and there need not be a finding of special circumstances to make a costs award approachingsubstantial indemnity (Sordi v. Sordi, [2011] O.J. No. 4681 (C.A.), para. 21).

[13] Evidence that a party has failed to make complete, frank and early disclosure, has putroadblocks in the way of the other party's disclosure requests, and has been evasive generally inproviding the information required to determine the issues in the case may fall within thedefinition of "bad faith". Failure to make financial disclosure alone supports both a finding ofbad faith and a determination of unreasonable behaviour, such that full recovery of costs is theappropriate outcome. However, a finding of bad faith is not the only basis upon which a courtcan consider a costs award in the full recovery range (Reisman v. Reisman, [2007] O.J No. 5538
(S.C.J), para. 3; KC. v. S.B., [2008] O.J No. 523 (S.C.J); DePace v. Michienzi, [2000] O.J 4436
(S.C.J); and Bourgeois v. Bourgeois; [2011] O.J No. 4034 (S.C.J).

[14] Unrepresented litigants may be awarded costs and such costs may include allowances forcounsel fees (Fang v. Chan (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330 (Ont. C.A.), para. 23).

[16]

In this case, the applicant asks for $30 per hour.

Costs to Be Awarded to the Applicant

[17] I agree with much of the applicant’s position. The respondent acted unreasonably in notproviding basic financial disclosure, which, in my estimation, dictated findings of lack ofcredibility against him and failure at the motion. Nonetheless, the applicant’s Offer to settle,dated February 27, 2017, was not better than what the applicant achieved on the motion in termsof child support for Thomas from May 1, 2014. Also, the Offer to settle was served on the eve ofthe motion, which did not give the respondent time to consult counsel about its reasonableness.
Although, I highly doubt that if he had consulted with counsel, the respondent would havesettled. I believe that he hoped to achieve some reduction in his support obligations before newsof his interests in Roto-Gro crystalized and his threats that he would have to file for bankruptcyshowed to be false.

[18] The applicant’s Bill of Costs for the period of April 21, 2014 to January 22, 2016 is for
$12,441.30. Two Case Conferences and four Settlement Conferences were held during thatperiod. Two of the Settlement Conferences did not proceed. One, as a result of the applicant’srequest and the other due to failure of both parties to confirm the proceeding.

[19] The applicant has not included daily dockets to substantiate and explain the almost 300
hours of work that she submits she spent to prepare for the Case Conferences and SettlementConferences. Costs for the matters were not reserved.

[20] The applicant shall have costs for her preparation for the matters in the amount of
$2000.00 plus HST and disbursements, which would be about 67 hours work at a rate of $30 perhour. That amount is more reasonable than what she has asked for in relation to the motion.
The Lawyer’s Fees

[21] The amount requested in fees for this motion is excessive. The Bill of Costs does not listdates or proper docket entries. It, instead, lists a total time spent on a summary of work done andhow long each task took. As a result, it is impossible to accurately assess the quantum of thecosts or each step in the case in accordance with Rule 24(10). There is no evidence of anyEndorsements under which costs were reserved to the adjudication of the motion. Various costshave already been ordered in the proceedings, including those for a summary judgment motionon May 31, 2016 before Justice Stevenson; an adjournment motion before Justice HarvisonYoung, dated December 13, 2016; and an adjournment motion before Justice Glustein, datedDecember 22, 2016.

[15] An hourly rate of $100 , $150 or $200 for a self-represented litigant is reasonable andappropriate for a well prepared self-represented litigant and it is appropriate that a costs order bemade in relation to the time and effort devoted to making cost submissions (Green v. Green,

[2008] O.J No. 3778 (S.C.J), para. 37).

[23] Rather than the $5,000.00 proposed by the respondent as reasonable for the motion, I findthat the applicant should be awarded $20,000.00 plus HST and disbursements for the costs of hersolicitor to prosecute the motion on her behalf. The respondent did not behave reasonably fromthe inception of his motion to change.

[24] Those costs to the applicant and on behalf of Ms. Kerr’s expenses shall be paid withinthirty days, enforceable as support.

McWatt, J.
Released: May 12, 2017

[22] The respondent claims that he has debts in excess of $330,000. Although I find that I
cannot wholeheartedly believe him, based on his behavior on this motion, I have accepted that hedid not have and may not yet have the money he will probably acquire from his investment in themedical marijuana company in which he is now involved. I have taken that fact into account inawarding costs against him in this matter.
