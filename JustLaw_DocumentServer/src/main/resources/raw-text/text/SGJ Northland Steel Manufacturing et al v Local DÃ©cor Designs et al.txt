EBERHARD J.

CITATION: S.G.J. Northland Steel Manufacturing et. al. v. Local Décor Designs et. al.
And between Weld-Tech Co. v. Local Décor Designs et. al.,2017 ONSC 3262
COURT FILE NO.: 12-0491 and 12-1389
DATE: 20170526

[1]

The Plaintiff, S. G. J. Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc. in the first action sues for, interalia, damages for breach of contract, breach of trust, punitive damages, interest and costson a substantial indemnity basis. Other claims were not pursued. As S. G. J. NorthlandSteel Manufacturing Inc. assumed the responsibilities of 2155339 Ontario Limited, thenumbered company suffered no damages and its claims are dismissed.

[2]

Weld-Tech Co. Ltd. in the second action before me, having been ordered to be heardtogether, sues for breach of contract, breach of trust, conversion, punitive damages,interest and costs on a substantial indemnity basis.

[3]

The Defendants did not appear. In each case they were noted in default.

[4]

The Defendants are deemed to admit the allegations of fact in the respective Statementsof Claims.

[5]

I granted leave under Rule 53.02(1) that the evidence be given by affidavit.

Facts as found:

[6]

S. G. J. Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc. and Local Decor Designs Inc. entered into acontract for Local Decor Designs Inc. to build an addition to the Plaintiff’s businesspremises with Local Decor Designs Inc. as general contractor. There was a fixed priceand the scope of the contract was defined. Draws were called for in 3 stages when thework for such stage was certified by AIM Engineering. The Defendants generalcontractor was paid the deposit and two of the three draws then abandoned the project.

[7]

Sub contractors’ liens were perfected in the sum of $128,000 and Weld-Tech Co. Ltd.
sued the Defendants without the benefit of a lien for work done for which they had notbeen paid.

[8]

S. G. J. Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc. and the lien claimants had a settlementmeeting as required under the Construction Lien Act.
S. G. J. Northland SteelManufacturing Inc. paid the lien claimants the $44,000 holdback. Releases were given.

[9]

To complete the project which should have been completed under the contract, thePlaintiff paid $218,386.55 as set out in the attached SCHEDULE OF DAMAGES (tab45). Based on the affidavit evidence of Om Sirpal, principal of S. G. J. Northland SteelManufacturing Inc., most of those amounts are fully supported by invoices alone. Othersrequired some explanation of the facts as found hereafter.

[10]

The roof supplied under the contract had to be replaced. In a Small Claims Court actionbetween Bert Huisman (roofer) and the Defendants, which binds the Defendants on thebasis of res judicata, Huisman obtained judgment against the Defendants. But it was alsofound that the roof was inadequate such that S. G. J. Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc.
sued Huisman and settled that litigation for $12,000. In the Schedule of Damages, the

[11]

The contract also required the Defendant to address grading. In order to achieve stormwater management required under the contract grading, a new plan had to be developedto retrofit what the Defendant left behind when the project was abandoned. The affidavitof Clayton Capes demonstrates the need for this new plan.

[12]

I am satisfied that neither the roof nor the storm management expenditures areimprovements or extras. They merely represent what had to be done to provide what thecontract set out.

[13]

Accordingly, the Plaintiff spent the $218,386.65 to complete the contract project, havingalready spent, by paying the Defendants directly $333,734.18, and lien claimants by wayof holdback $44,000 for a total of $596,120.83.

[14]

The Plaintiff is entitled to be put in the position it would have been had the contract notbeen breached. The contract price was $491,550. Damages are the difference:
$104,570.83. Judgment is to issue for that amount.

[15]

Local Decor Designs Inc. was the party to the contract.
liable under the contract.

[16]

On the question of the personal liability of Michael Merlino, a corporate search shows heis the sole officer and director of Local Decor Designs Inc. He is the operating mind. Heis the person who entered into the contract for his company Local Decor Designs Inc.
However, there is little evidence as to what led up to his abandoning the project.

[17]

Under s. 8 of the Construction Lien Act, where the contractor was paid (2/3 of the drawson account of the contract), all amounts paid to the contractor are imposed with a trust forthe benefit of subcontractors and others who supplied services who have not been paid.
Other use is a conversion. We have no evidence (beyond suspicions raised by lifestyle)
of other use.

[18]

I find that Local Decor Designs Inc.’s obvious non-payment of sub-contractors at thetime of abandonment, evidenced by $128,000 in claimed liens, is a breach of trust.

[19]

According to Section 13 of the Construction Lien Act, a director or officer who assentsto or acquiesces in conduct he knows or ought to know is a breach of trust by thecorporation is liable for the breach of trust. Michael Merlino is the director and officer.

[20]

Accordingly, I find that damages of $104,570.83 are owed to the Plaintiff, S. G. J.
Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc. by the Defendant, Local Decor Designs Inc. and theDefendant, Michael Merlino, jointly and severally.

Local Decor Designs Inc. is

Plaintiff has credited the Defendants with that $12,000 against the $26,640.00
replacement cost for the roof.

[21]

I do not find this is a proper case for punitive damages. The special qualities of extremeconduct deserving of full condemnation required by case law (Visnjic v. LaSalle (Town)

[2017] O.J. No. 2114, at para 127-132) are not demonstrated on the evidence.

[22]

As to the claim of Weld-Tech Co. Ltd., I find the breach of contract is made out andJudgment is to issue that Local Decor Designs Inc. owes this sub-contractor for goodsand services rendered in the amount of $19,210.00 inclusive of HST.

[23]

I do not find Michael Merlino liable as there is no evidence that Weld-Tech Co. Ltd. hadprovided goods and services at the time of the last draw to impress those monies with atrust for Weld-Tech Co. Ltd.

[24]

Pre and post judgment interest are fixed in both actions at the Court of Justices Act rate.

[25]

Although both parties seek costs on a substantial indemnity basis, all I can see impactingon the factors is that these Plaintiffs succeeded in their respective law suits. Costs followthat success but I see no grounds for enhanced costs.

[26]

The Defendants, Local Decor Designs Inc. and Michael Merlino shall pay the Plaintiff,S. G. J. Northland Steel Manufacturing Inc., costs which I fix at $4,882.60.

[27]

The Defendant, Local Decor Designs Inc., shall pay the Plaintiff, Weld-Tech Co. Ltd.,costs which I fix at $1,751.86
