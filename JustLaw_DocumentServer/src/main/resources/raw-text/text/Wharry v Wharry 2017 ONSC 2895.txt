ENDORS E M E N T

[1]

The respondent Karen Wharry brings this motion under Family Law Rule

25(19) to change the final order of this court dated October 16, 2016. Ms. Wharryseeks an order changing the amount John Wharry has been ordered to pay herfor an equalization payment under section 5 of the Family Law Act, from $80,449
(£42,944) to $155,898.26 (£87,094).

[2]

Mr. Wharry opposes the motion. As a preliminary matter, Mr. Wharry

submits that I am functus officio because the final order has already been issuedand entered with the court.

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE – ONTARIO

[3]

In this endorsement, I intend to decide this preliminary issue only. This

under Family Law Rule 25(19).
Brief Background

[4]

The parties married in 1992 in Northern Ireland. In 2002, they immigrated

to Canada and operated a farm they purchased together near Kincardine,Ontario.

[5]

The parties separated in Ontario in November 2006.

[6]

Mr. Wharry commenced an application under the Divorce Act and under

the Family Law Act in 2007.

[7]

Justice Dunn made an order on June 25, 2008 disposing of several

issues the parties were able to resolve. Justice Dunn made an order on consentthat included the settlement of Ms. Wharry’s equalization claim for all propertyowned by Mr. Wharry and herself with respect to property in Ontario. In thecourse of that settlement, Mr. Wharry paid Ms. Wharry $85,000 to purchase herinterest in the Kincardine farm.

[8]

Justice Dunn’s order set out the remaining issues for trial. The trial took

place before me in Walkerton for two weeks in November 2014.

endorsement does not contain any decision on the merits of the motion itself

[9]

My Reasons for Decision granting judgment on all remaining issues were

pay $80,449.76 to Ms. Wharry for an equalization payment with respect toproperty in Northern Ireland that he had received from his father during themarriage that was not found to be a gift.

[10]

On November 13, 2015, counsel for Ms. Wharry filed a notice of appeal

dated November 13, 2015 to appeal the final order I had made to the Court ofAppeal for Ontario.

[11]

On January 21, 2016 I released an endorsement awarding costs of the

trial to John Wharry fixed in the amount of $10,000, plus disbursements andHST.

[12]

In the course of perfecting the appeal, counsel for Ms. Wharry had the

final order entered on February 8, 2016.

[13]

The Court of Appeal heard the appeal of the trial judgment on November

10, 2016. The appeal decision was released at 2016 ONCA 930 on December13, 2016. The court dismissed all of Ms. Wharry’s grounds of appeal with respectto property and equalization issues, and allowed the appeal only with respect tospousal support, retroactive child support and section 7 expenses.

released on October 16, 2015. Those reasons included an order that Mr. Wharry

[14]

In respect of costs for the appeal, the court reduced the amount of costs

January 25, 2017. The court awarded no costs for the appeal itself.

[15]

Mr. Cohen submits that it was when the parties were corresponding

earlier this year to arrange for Mr. Wharry to make the equalization paymentunder the judgment that a mathematical miscalculation was detected in myReasons for Decision.

Mr. Cohen contends on behalf of Ms. Wharry that the

value of his one half share of the bungalow should have been added to thecomputation of Mr. Wharry’s net family property. This would have the effect ofincreasing Mr. Wharry’s net family property, thereby increasing the equalizationpayment he owes to Ms. Wharry.

[16]

Mr. Wharry submits that once the final order was entered, I became

functus officio. In any event, he states that I made no mathematical error whencalculating the net family property of each party in the Reasons for Decision. Mr.Wharry further submits that Ms. Wharry has already appealed every aspect ofthe final order, and that the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment with respect toproperty and equalization issues. He submits that with the final order entered andthe appeal concluded, the case between Ms. Wharry and himself should beconsidered finished and over with.

awarded to Mr. Wharry at trial from $10,000 to $7,000 for reasons released on

[17]

Ms. Wharry brings her motion to change the final order based on my

Reasons for Decision under the procedure suggested by the Court of Appealrecently in Gray v. Gray, 2017 ONCA 100.

[18]

In Gray, the respondent had been ordered to pay significant spousal

support arrears and ongoing child support at trial. The order was made in hisabsence because the trial judge did not accept his excuse for not attending thetrial.

[19]

The respondent in Gray commenced an appeal of the order to the Court

of Appeal. Shortly thereafter, the respondent brought a motion under Family LawRule 25(19)(e) before the Superior Court of Justice to set aside the order thecourt had made in his absence. The motion to change seeking an order to setaside the final order had not been heard at the time the appeal was considered.
The Court of Appeal in Gray held that the power to change a final order within themeaning of Family Law Rule 25(19) includes the authority of this court to setaside a previous order.

Analysis

[20]

I am of the view that the circumstances before me are distinguishable

subsequent appeal. In Gray, judgment was obtained in the absence of therespondent who had not yet presented evidence. The respondent in Gray hadalready launched a motion to have the order set aside under Family Law Rule25(19).

[21]

The present circumstances between Ms. Wharry and Mr. Wharry provide

a context for the court to consider the preliminary argument made by Mr. Wharrythat I am functus officio. These are circumstances that were not available to theparties in Gray.

[22]

A judge who has made an order remains seized of a matter and has the

power to reconsider, vary or revoke the judgment until he or she becomesfunctus officio of the case.

[23]

It was said by Laidlaw, J.A. in Holmes Foundery Ltd. v. Point Edward
“it is well settled in law that an order can always be withdrawn, altered ormodified by a judge either on his own initiative or on the application of a partyuntil such time as the order can be drawn up, passed and entered.”

[24]

A judge becomes functus officio when an order is issued and entered:

Gray v. Rizzi, 2010 ONSC 2858 and Chand v. Insurance Corp. of British

from the facts in Gray. In this case, the parties have engaged in a full trial and a

Columbia, 2009 BCSC 4. Justice Del Frate squarely stated the applicable

Clement v. Clement, 2015 ONSC 5654 in the following terms:

[11] Case law is quite clear that a judge becomes functus when “the order orjudgment is signed and entered.” See 369413 Alberta Ltd. v. Pocklington, [2000]
A.J. No. 410 (Q.B.); Condominium Plan No. 7510189 v. Jones, 1997 ABCA 53(C.A.).

[13]
This principle is also enunciated by Perrel and Morden in The Law of CivilProcedure in Ontario, 1st ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2010), at p. 777:
….until the order in question has been signed and entered, the lower court is notfunctus officio and still has jurisdiction over the case, with the necessaryconsequence that the appellate court does not have jurisdiction to decide theappeal.

[25]

On the basis of the authorities cited to me, I became functus officio when

the final order between the parties in this case was issued and entered.
However, Mr. Cohen urges me to exercise certain residual jurisdiction I have tochange the final order as entered within the narrow exception discussed inparagraph 12 of Clement v. Clement. That jurisdiction is found only if a mistakehas been made in the process of putting the judgment to paper and finalizing it,or if there has been an error in expressing the intention of the court.

principles about when, and what it means for a judge to become functus officio in

[26]

I have been provided no authority for the exception to the functus officio

simply transposing the decision about the issues from the reasons given, to theform of the final order that is entered. It must consist of a function sostraightforward that, absent fraud, judicial analysis or discretion is not required,and another judge should not be troubled by a matter that is in essence clerical innature.

[27]

The understanding of what constitutes a “mistake” for the purpose of

qualifying as an exception to the functus officio principle is therefore muchnarrower than the understanding of what constitutes a “mistake” for the purposesof changing an order that has already been entered under Family Law Rule25(19)(b). What might even be considered a “mistake” for the purpose of FamilyLaw Rule 25(19) is extremely limited.

[28]

The court in Abitbol v. Abitbol, 2017 ONSC 571 refers to McLeod’s

Ontario Family Law Rules Annotated, 2016-2017 for the following statement as astarting point for the scope of Family Law Rule 25(19)(b):
“Rule 25(19)(b) should be used to correct technical mistakes due to inadvertenceor oversight in order to ensure that the court’s intention is accurately reflected.
The rule cannot be used to empower the court to revisit, reopen and reargue acase or allow a court to hear an appeal of its own decision.”

principle other than Clement v. Clement. That residual power is restricted to

[29]

In Feldman v. Ford, 2014 ONSC 7466 (SCJ), the court held that a motion

under

Family

Rule

25(19)(b)

is

“specifically

designed

to

address

typographical errors.” In Henderson v. Henderson, 2015 ONSC 2914 (SCJ), therestrictive scope of the stated purpose of the rule is to correct “a mistake in thecontent of the order, for instance where the order contains a typographical error,a misstatement of what was actually endorsed by the court, or a mathematicalmiscalculation.” See also Stephens v. Stephens, 2016 ONSC 367.

[30]

Mr. Cohen submits that Ms. Wharry does not seek an order setting aside

any part of the final order, as in Gray v. Gray. Ms. Wharry does not ask for anychange to a finding of fact or a ruling of law in the judgment. Rather, Mr. Cohensubmits that Ms. Wharry seeks only a mathematical correction consistent withwhat the court intended the judgment to say.

[31]

To the contrary, I find that Ms. Wharry is asking for a great deal more

than that.

[32]

Ms. Wharry is seeking a further finding by the court that an addition

should be made to Mr. Wharry’s net family property in order to increase theequalization payment she is to receive. I say nothing of the findings of fact in theReasons for Decision that Mr. Wharry’s father gifted him the farm on DrumcrowRoad that included the bungalow (at paragraphs 83 and 138), or that a monetary

Law

amount was awarded to Ms. Wharry for the value of her contribution to the

the date of separation that was given as a credit in her column, and taken as adebit in his (in paragraphs 143, 144, and 145 of the Reasons for Decision).

[33]

Ms. Wharry is really alleging that a legal error has been made for which

she seeks a different result. This purpose is outside the narrow exception to thefunctus officio rule discussed in Clement v. Clement, and in my view, beyond thescope of Family Law Rule 25(19) considered in Henderson v. Henderson. TheCourt of Appeal agreed with the statement made by Boswell J in the decisionunder appeal in Gray v. Rizzi, 2011 ONCA 436 when he said:
The Rule was not, in my view, intended to apply to cases of alleged legal errors,such as the suggestion that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in making theorder. Mistakes, or errors in law are appealable errors and are not subject tocorrection under Rule 25(19).

[34]

The change Ms. Wharry asks this court to make is conceptual in nature,

and legal in character. It is not the kind of correction borne of a mathematicalmiscalculation. It is not the kind of mistake to qualify as a possible exception tothe principle that makes me functus officio. Ms. Wharry brings this motion underthe guise of a motion to change a technical mistake, when she is really making afurther appeal.

bungalow. This award of a monetary amount represented a debt of £44,000 at

[35]

It is therefore my conclusion that I am functus officio, and that I have no

prejudice to either party to bring another motion under Family Law Rule 25(19)
for hearing by another judge of this court.

[36]

I have not considered whether Family Law Rule 25(19) can replenish me

with jurisdiction to hear the motion notwithstanding my conclusion I am functusofficio. I did not hear submissions from the parties on this point, and neither partyhas provided any legal authority for it. It would be unfair to either party for me tomake such a determination in view of those circumstances.

[37]

If either party seeks costs on the matter that has been adjudicated, that

party may make written submissions by May 31, 2017. The responding partyshall then have until June 14, 2017 to file responding submissions. Neither set ofsubmissions shall consist of more than two double spaced typewritten pages. Allwritten submissions may be made by faxing my Judicial Assistant, Ms. PriscillaGutierrez at 905-456-4834 at Brampton.
