RE:

CHRIS OUSLIS, ApplicantAND:
MARCIA LEBOU OUSLIS, Respondent

BEFORE:

THE HONOURABLE MADAM JUSTICE VALLEE

COUNSEL: L. Liquornik, for the ApplicantM. Ouslis, self-representedHEARD:

May 15, 2017
ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The trial of this matter commenced in January and concluded in June, 2016. TheReasons for Decision were released on October 25, 2016. The Costs Endorsement wasreleased on April 12, 2017.

[2]

Ms. Ouslis brings two motions found at Tabs 8 and 10, Volume 14 of the ContinuingRecord. Both notices of motion are dated April 23, 2017. Both motions are broughtpursuant to Rule 25(19).

[3]

Ms. Ouslis requests that the court “void” the judgment. She makes a number ofallegations in support of this request which can be broadly grouped into three categories:
a) Mr. Ouslis’ conduct prior to trial

[4]

Ms. Ouslis states that prior to trial, Mr. Ouslis failed to satisfy his disclosure obligationsand failed to answer undertakings. Accordingly, some of the findings at trial were basedon false misrepresentations.
b) Errors and Omissions

[5]

Ms. Ouslis states that the judgment contains a number of errors and omissions. Some ofthe amounts listed for bank accounts and investments on Mr. Ouslis’ net family propertystatement are wrong. He had certain assets on the date of separation that are not listed.

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO

[6]

The current beneficiaries of Mr. Ouslis’ Manulife life insurance plan are Ms. Ouslis as to50% and Natasha Ouslis, the eldest daughter as to 50%. Ms. Ouslis states that she shouldbe the sole irrevocable beneficiary because the policy should insure Mr. Ouslis’ supportobligations. Furthermore, he has two other policies. Ms. Ouslis states that she shouldshare in the cash surrender value of them. Mr. Ouslis should provide an actuarialassessment of the amount of life insurance required to insure his support obligations. Heshould be ordered to purchase additional life insurance because the existing policy of
$250,000 is inadequate.

Rule 25(19)

[7]

The purpose of Rule 25(19) is to allow for an order to be changed if it contains a mistake,if it needs to be changed to deal a matter that was before the court but that it did notdecide or if it was obtained by fraud. Rule 25(19) does not allow findings of fact or lawto be revisited. Arguments regarding the correctness of the order can only be made onappeal. Rule 25(19) does not allow for errors in law to be corrected nor does it permit anorder to be set aside. It does not provide an opportunity for a party to re-litigate thematter.

Disclosure

[8]

Ms. Ouslis states that Mr. Ouslis did not comply with his disclosure obligations prior totrial and did not comply with certain related orders made at conferences. Prior to trial,Ms. Ouslis had a remedy. As I noted in para. 58 of my Reasons for Decision, the minutesof settlement dated November 19, 2014, reserved Ms. Ouslis’ right to bring a motion tostrike the applicant’s pleadings if he failed to produce the required disclosure. She didnot bring such a motion nor did she bring a motion against third parties for production.

Discrepancies in Bank Balances and Investment Accounts

[9]

I addressed this issue in paras. 88 to 90 in my Reasons for Decision. Mr. Ouslis’ evidenceat trial was that his bank accounts, investments, LIRA and his 50 percent share of certaincorporate accounts totalled $600,962.17 on the date of separation. Ms. Ouslis challengedthis amount on cross-examination and suggested that he had certain investments that hehad not included. His response was that he had not listed all of them separately. Rather,he provided a total and attached supporting documents for each one to his net familyproperty statement. Ms. Ouslis did not pursue this issue. If she had documents thatshowed otherwise, she ought to have put them to him. He should have had an opportunityto comment on them. The documents upon which she now relies do not appear to benewly discovered. Ms. Ouslis’ cross-examination of Mr. Ouslis focused primarily oncertain corporate transactions that significantly preceded the date of separation.

c) Life Insurance

[10]

At trial, Ms. Ouslis agreed that there were two life insurance policies. She also agreed onthe value of them. She now alleges that Mr. Ouslis had two additional insurance policiesat the date of separation which he did not disclose. She refers to a Royal and Sun Alliancepolicy and an Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada policy. Mr. Ouslis’ evidenceat trial and on this motion is that the Royal policy was an investment vehicle which wasrolled over into a LIRA. It was included on his net family property statement. He statesthat the Equitable Life policy is a disability policy. He did disclose that policy. Itcontinues to exist.

[11]

If Ms. Ouslis was concerned that the Manulife life insurance policy was inadequate toinsure Mr. Ouslis’ support obligations, she should have provided evidence of this at trialto support her position. She did not obtain an actuarial opinion. A summate calculationon Divorcemate would show a lump sum for the support order. Ms. Ouslis did notprovide me with any Divorcemate calculations.

[12]

If Mr. Ouslis dies and the life insurance amount is insufficient, his support obligationremains a first charge on his estate.

Fraud

[13]

The test for fraud is onerous. Based on the record before me, Ms. Ouslis has not satisfiedme that Mr. Ouslis made any representations at trial which he knew to be false nor did heproduce any documents which he knew were false or misleading.

Beneficiary of Life Insurance Policy

[14]

With respect to the Manulife policy, at one point, all of the children were beneficiaries,despite the fact that three of them are minors. Ms. Ouslis states that she should be namedthe sole irrevocable beneficiary. According to Mr. Ouslis, after the Reasons for Decisionwere released, he designated Ms. Ouslis as a 50% beneficiary and the eldest daughterNatasha as a 50% beneficiary. His logic in doing so is that the two younger childrenreside primarily with Ms. Ouslis whereas the eldest son, Sebastian, resides with him.
Natasha is an adult attending university. Ms. Ouslis is estranged from Sebastian. She hasvery little contact with Natasha. In the event of his death, the Mr. Ouslis wants Natasha toreceive 50% of the insurance proceeds to benefit herself and Sebastian.

[15]

Given the living arrangements of this family and the strained relationship that Ms. Ouslishas with Natasha and Sebastian, I find that the Mr. Ouslis’ designation of beneficiaries onhis life insurance policy to be appropriate.

[16]

Several other issues were raised during submissions which I will address below.

Life Insurance

[17]

With respect to Mr. Ouslis’ group benefits pursuant to his employment, his evidence onthis motion is that after trial, he provided a group benefits card to Ms. Ouslis. Hisevidence is that she and the children are covered under this plan.

[18]

Ms. Ouslis states that she has provided to Mr. Ouslis receipts for certain medicalexpenses for submission to the insurer; however, Mr. Ouslis has not reimbursed her forthem. I am unable to determine credibility on this issue in the absence of better evidence.

RESP

[19]

Ms. Ouslis has not yet reimbursed Mr. Ouslis in accordance with the judgment. Ms.Ouslis maintains that she has not yet been provided with proof of enrolment for Natashawhich is required for funds to be released from the RESP. Mr. Ouslis states that he hasprovided her with statements showing the various expenses incurred with respect toNatasha’s education. I suggested that a statement is not the same as a proof of enrollmentdocument. I directed Mr. Ouslis to obtain a proof of enrolment document and forward itto Ms. Ouslis to satisfy this issue. Once Ms. Ouslis has the proof of enrolment document,she shall take steps to ensure that the amount payable, as set out in the judgment, is paidto Mr. Ouslis from the RESP.

Funds in Trust

[20]

According to a trust statement provided by Mr. Ouslis, Mr. Cirillo holds $915,391.81 intrust. He shall pay $178,480.45 to Ms. Ouslis and $736.911.37 to Mr. Ouslis. Thecalculations for these amounts are set out in Schedule ‘A’.

Divorce

[21]

Ms. Ouslis states that Mr. Ouslis cannot proceed with a divorce because he is in arrearsregarding support. Reasonable arrangements are in place for the support of Ms. Ouslisand the children. Upon filing a FRO statement that there are no arrears, Mr. Ouslis mayproceed with a divorce on an uncontested basis.

[22]

Ms. Ouslis stated in submissions that these two motions will be followed by many moreon other issues. Ms. Ouslis is not permitted to bring any further motions without priorjudicial approval.
