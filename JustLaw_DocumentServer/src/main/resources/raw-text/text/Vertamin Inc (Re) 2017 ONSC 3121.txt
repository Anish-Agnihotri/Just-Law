R. SMITH J.
COSTS DECISION

[1]

The Trustee was successful in obtaining an order annulling Vertamin’s Proposal in

Bankruptcy and in responding to the Debtor’s cross-motion for permission to sue for $10 milliondollars. The Trustee seeks costs of $82,958.01 recoverable as a priority claim against the funds itholds in the failed Priority.

[2]

Vertamin has not made any submissions on costs.

Factors

[3]

The factors to be considered when fixing costs are set out in Rule 57 of the

Rules of Civil Procedure and include in addition to success, the amount claimed and recovered,the complexity and importance of the matter and the principle of proportionality, the conduct ofany party which unduly lengthened the proceeding, whether any step was improper, vexatious orunnecessary, or taken through negligence mistake or excessive caution, a party’s denial or

ONTARIO

refusal to admit anything, any offer to settle, the principle of indemnity, scale of costs, hourlyrate claimed in relation to the partial indemnity rate set out in the Information to the Profession

expect to pay.

[4]

The Trustee was completely successful on its motion and the cross-motion. The matter

was complex and involved a claim of $10 million dollars against the Trustee, which indicatedthat the matter was important to the parties.

[5]

The Trustee’s full legal costs would ordinarily be recoverable as a preferred claim under

S. 136(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3). However,the Trustee is unable to recover costs against the undischarged bankrupt as would ordinarily bethe case.
Disposition

[6]

Given the factual complexity, the unfounded allegations of professional negligence and

conduct against the Trustee and the fact the Trustee would ordinarily recover its full costs, andthe amounts sought were within the expectations of the losing party. The Trustee’s costs arefixed at $82,958.01 on a full indemnity basis.

[7]

The Trustee is entitled to recover $82,958.01 under S. 136(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) as a priority

claim against the funds that it holds in the failed Proposal.
