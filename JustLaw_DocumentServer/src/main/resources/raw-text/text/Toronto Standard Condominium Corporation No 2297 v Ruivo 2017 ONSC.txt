COUNSEL: Jonathan H. Fine and Dalia Yonadam, for the Moving PartySergio Ruivo, In PersonAmeed Al-Masri, In PersonHEARD:

In WritingLEAVE TO APPEAL ENDORSEMENT

[1]
The moving party seeks leave to appeal the interlocutory order of the motion judge datedDecember 29, 2016.

[2]
This motion arises out of a proceeding that commenced as an application for a range ofinjunctive and/or declaratory relief brought by the moving party against the responding parties.

[3]
On October 4, 2016, the motion judge granted interlocutory relief to the moving party.
The motion judge adjourned the balance of the moving party’s application upon terms to permitAmeed Al-Masri to file responding material. Mr. Al-Masri filed a significant volume ofresponding material but not in proper affidavit form. When the matter came on again before thesame motion judge on December 6, 2016, the motion judge again adjourned the matter so thatMr. Al-Masri could refile his responding material in proper affidavit form. This matter came onagain before the same motion judge on December 21, 2016 and Mr. Al-Masri attempted to filehis material in affidavit form but in fact had only sworn an affidavit of service. The motion judgeaccepted Mr. Al-Masri’s explanation that he thought he had complied with the rules and, in theinterests of justice, received Mr. Al-Masri’s material on the motion.

[4]
After considering the material, the motion judge decided, in an order dated December 29,2016, to convert the application into an action and order a trial because the material containedextensive factual disputes and raised numerous issues of credibility. In the interim, the motionjudge made an order prohibiting Mr. Al-Masri from having any contact with the concierge deskat the moving party.

[5]
The moving party submits that the motion judge erred by relying on Mr. Al-Masri’sunsworn material and seeks leave to appeal the December 29, 2016 order.

[6]

Leave to appeal is denied.

[7]
The test for granting leave to appeal under Rule 62.02(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, is well-settled. It is recognized that leave should not be easily grantedand the test to be met is a very strict one. There are two possible branches upon which leave maybe granted. Both branches involve a two-part test and, in each case, both aspects of the two-parttest must be met before leave may be granted.

[8]
Under Rule 62.02(4)(a), the moving party must establish that there is a conflictingdecision of another judge or court in Ontario or elsewhere (but not a lower level court) and that itis, in the opinion of the judge hearing the motion, “desirable that leave to appeal be granted.”

[9]
A “conflicting decision” must be with respect to a matter of principle, not merely asituation in which a different result was reached in respect of particular facts: ComtradePetroleum Inc. v. 490300 Ontario Ltd. (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 542, 55 O.A.C. 316 (Div. Ct.).

[10] The moving party has not pointed to any decisions that conflict with respect to matters ofprinciple, as opposed to decisions in which judges have exercised their discretion differently ondifferent facts.

[11] In its factum, at para. 43, the moving party says that the motion judge’s decision conflictswith various decision of Ontario courts cited at paras. 44-52, 58-65, 68, 72 of the factum. Theonly one that is arguably a “conflicting decision” is Luxon v. Bethesda Home for the MentallyHandicapped Inc., 2005 CarswellOnt 71, [2005] O.J. No. 58 (BOA, Tab 25) where Quinn J.
held, at paras. 19-22, that it would be inappropriate to allow the plaintiff to lead evidence otherthan by affidavit in a summary trial under Rule 76. The present case is distinguishable fromLuxon. In this case, the motion judge relied on the responding party’s materials to conclude therewere factual disputes requiring both a trial and the conversion of the application to an action; thematerials, with which we are concerned, were not used in a trial.

[12] Under Rule 62.02(4)(b), the moving party must establish that there is reason to doubt thecorrectness of the order in question and that the proposed appeal involves matters of suchimportance that leave to appeal should be granted. It is not necessary that the judge grantingleave be satisfied that the decision in question was actually wrong – the first part of the test issatisfied if the judge granting leave finds that the correctness of the order is open to “very seriousdebate”: Nazari v. OTIP/RAEO Insurance Co., [2003] O.T.C. 794, 3 C.C.L.I. (4th) 149 (Sup.

(1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 569, 1986 CanLII 2749 (H.C.J.); Greslik v. Ontario Legal Aid Plan (1988),65 O.R. (2d) 110, 30 O.A.C. 53 (Div. Ct.).

[13] The Superior Court of Justice has an inherent jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters. InOntario v. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, theSupreme Court of Canada cited with approval an article by I.H. Jacob entitled “The InherentJurisdiction of the Court” ((1970) 23 Curr. Legal Probs. 23), which defined, at p. 51, the court’sinherent jurisdiction in the following terms: “[T]he inherent jurisdiction of the court may bedefined as being the reserve or fund of powers, a residual source of powers, which the court maydraw upon as necessary whenever it is just or equitable to do so and in particular … to do justicebetween the parties and to secure a fair trial between them.”

[14] The motion judge had a residual authority to receive the unsworn material because thereis no law, regulation or rule of procedure that specifically prohibited the motion judge fromdoing that. While Rule 39.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides that evidence on anapplication may be given by way of affidavit, Rule 2.01(1) provides that a failure to comply withthe Rules is an irregularity and does not render a document, among other things, a nullity. Rule2.01(1)(a) also provides that the court may grant all necessary “amendments or other relief, onsuch terms as are just, to secure the just determination of the real matters in dispute.” Finally,Rule 1.04(1) provides that the Rules are to be liberally construed to secure “the just, mostexpeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits.” Far fromdepriving the motion judge of the authority to do what he did, the Rules reinforce His Honour’spower to ensure that matters are fairly considered on their merits.

[15] The motion judge was not obliged to ignore the unsworn material. Accordingly, HisHonour’s decision to receive it cannot amount to a breach of the “appearance and reality ofjudicial neutrality” or lead to a conclusion that His Honour “failed to fairly balance the issues.”

[16] At paragraph 53 (b) the applicant seems to be complaining about the motion judge'sdecision on December 6, 2016 to grant a further adjournment. However, the applicant states inparagraph 4 of its factum that it seeks leave to appeal the motion judge's order of December 29,2016 rather than the order of December 6, 2016. In any event, even though His Honour hadpreviously stated that the December 6, 2016 date was peremptory upon Mr. Al-Masri, the courtstill retained jurisdiction to adjourn the matter on that date and its decision to do so cannot leadto a conclusion that the order of that date is somehow incorrect.

[17] His Honour could have adjourned the application again. Alternatively, His Honour couldhave dealt with the application and ignored the unsworn material. Finally, His Honour couldhave done what he did. Even if I thought His Honour was wrong to do what he did, which I do

[18]

Accordingly, this motion is dismissed. There will be no costs.

not, the order complained of resulted from a case-specific exercise of discretion and therefore isnot capable of having an importance beyond the interests of the immediate parties.
