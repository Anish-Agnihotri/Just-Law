CITATION: Cormier v. Duesling, 2017 ONSC 3073
COURT FILE NO.: FS-840-15
DATE: 2017-05-18

RE:

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO
Andrea Cormier, ApplicantAND:
Daniel John Duesling, RespondentBEFORE:

The Honourable Mr. Justice G.A. Campbell

COUNSEL: Alex Toolsie, Counsel for the Mother/ApplicantBrent Balmer, Counsel for the Father/Respondent/Moving PartyCOSTS ENDORSEMENT

[1]

I have received, read and considered both counsel’s written submissions on this last issue.

[2]

Rule 24 provides, inter alia, that successful litigants are presumed to be entitled to “the

costs of a motion”.

In this matter the Respondent, Mr. Duesling, commenced his Motion to

Change to terminate his child support obligation to his two now-adult daughters and rescindany/all accumulated arrears of child support that may remain owing. He made no offer to settleat any time.

[3]

The responding party, Ms. Cormier, lives in Angus, Ontario.

Mr. Duesling lives in

Kitchener. The motion was commenced and proceeded in Kitchener. That reality required Ms.Cormier to travel to Kitchener on January 11, 2016, June 29, 2016, February 8, 2017 andFebruary 13, 2017 that I know of.

Costs “at each step” (R. 24.10) were only addressed and awarded at $500 plus HST plus

$150 disbursements on February 8, 2017.
endorsements are silent regarding costs.

Otherwise, all of the presiding judges and other

The February 8, 2017 costs order has already been

made and stands alone.

[5]

Reluctantly, despite the obvious and clear success of Ms. Cormier resisting Mr.

Duesling’s motion, I agree with Mr. Balmer’s argument that if Rule 24.10 is to have any effect orrelevance, costs must be sought, considered and awarded at each of the discrete stages of amotion/proceeding recognized by the Rules; such as a case conference, argued motion orsettlement conference. See Husein v. Chatoor 2005 ONCJ 487.

[6]

In this proceeding no costs were sought or awarded at the case and settlement

conferences on January 11, 2016 and June 29, 2016.

[7]

Accordingly, the expenses attributable to those dates are disallowed.

[8]

It is now trite law that:
(a)

costs are to be decided in a summary matter;

(b)

not serving any offers to settle can be reflected in costs orders – offers tosettle contained in case conference or settlement conference briefs are notRule 18 offers to settle, but Rule 18(16) allows the court discretion to “takeinto account” any written offer to settle; when it was made and the terms ofthat offer;

(c)

“proportionality” to the issues argued rather than an unquestioned relianceon hours billed and documents created is the proper approach to decidingcosts;

(d)

costs should be viewed with flexibility and in “a balanced manner”,recognizing the court’s wide discretion;

[4]

[9]

(e)

a costs order should represent a fair and reasonable amount that should bepaid rather than any exact measure of the actual costs;

(f)

costs should be assessed to result in a sensible and fair result consistent withwhat an unsuccessful party might reasonably have expected to pay; and

(g)

in order to have some idea of what the “unsuccessful party” should/couldhave expected, his/her counsel are encouraged to disclose the account thatthat party received from his/her own counsel, if exception to the quantum ofthe successful party is objected to.

In this matter, Mr. Balmer has elected not to disclose his own account to his client but

objects to the amount Ms. Cormier seeks. That strategy is unhelpful.

[10]

In her settlement conference brief of June 24, 2016, Ms. Cormier offered to settle the

Respondent’s motion for far less than was ordered by the court on February 17, 2017.

In

hindsight, Mr. Duesling should have settled on those terms immediately. He chose not to do so.
Therefore costs consequences follow.

[11]

Rule 18(16) allows me to take that reality “into account” (when deciding costs).

[12]

As a result, after examining the factors set out in Rule 24(11) and applying them to the

[13]

All of these costs were incurred with respect to an order for support. They are “legal fees

or other expenses arising in relation to support or maintenance” and as such, shall be enforceable

Enforcement Act 1996, S.O. 1996, c.31 (as amended) and Wildman v. Wildman (2006), 82 O.R.
(3d) 401 (C.A.)) and I so order.
