HOOD J.
REASONS FOR DECISION
Overview

[1]
In 2013, the applicant Duong Xuan Bui and respondent Thu Anh Thi Nguyen separatedafter a 20-year marriage.

[2]
At trial, the parties argued primarily over their property and what should or should not beincluded in their net family property for equalization purposes under the Family Law Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. F.3. While there were a multitude of property disputes at the commencement of trial,including disputes over properties in Montreal and Vietnam, by the closing submissions thenumber of property disputes had been reduced to the following:
a)

the ownership of diamond rings, at the date of separation;

b)

the attribution of funds held in a Bank of America bank account, at the date ofseparation;

CITATION: Bui v. Nguyen, 2017 ONSC 2562
COURT FILE NO.: FS-13-389839-0000
DATE: 20170516

c)

whether there was a debt owing to the applicant’s sister with respect to a jointlyowned property in California, at the date of separation;

d)

whether the respondent had a number of personal debts owing, at the date ofseparation;

e)

the value of a Honda automobile owned by the respondent, at the date ofmarriage; and

f)

the value of RRSPs owned by the respondent, at the date of marriage.

[3]
During closing arguments, the respondent asked for a right of first refusal on one of thejointly-owned properties, which the parties had agreed should be sold. This was opposed by theapplicant.

[4]
There was no disagreement over the respondent’s entitlement to spousal support. Theparties, however, disagreed as to the amount of spousal support, based primarily on theirdisagreement as to the applicant’s income.

[5]
There was no argument over child support, but s. 7 expenses under the Federal ChildSupport Guidelines, S.O.R./97-175 remained an issue between the parties and the proportion tobe paid by each.

Equalization IssuesDiamond Rings

[7]
The parties agree that the diamond rings are to be valued at $8,000, as part of theequalization. Based upon this, I take it that the parties agree the rings did exist. They cannotagree as to where the rings were at the date of separation. The applicant’s position is that he doesnot know where the rings were or where they currently are. The respondent’s position is that theapplicant took the rings. Each says the agreed value of $8,000, should form part of the other’sassets owned on valuation day.

[8]
With no evidence from either party as to the rings’ location on the date of separation, I
am unable to resolve this dispute. Accordingly, their value should not be attributed to eitherparty. This results in the value of the general household items and vehicles on valuation daybeing $92,022.50, for the applicant and $24,181.25, for the respondent.
Bank of America Joint Bank Account

[9]
The parties agree that the amount in this account as at the date of separation was
$19,222.69. They disagree over how this should be attributed for equalization purposes. Theapplicant’s position is that it should be divided equally with each party being credited with
$9,611.34. The respondent’s position is that the total amount should be credited to the applicant.

[11] This account was opened in the name of the applicant, the respondent and the applicant’ssister, Kiem Thi Bui. While purportedly originally opened for the purposes of managing thejointly owned property in California, over time its use changed. Eventually, it was also used bythe applicant to send money to his mother, who was living in Florida, for her support. To do this,the applicant wired money from one of his personal accounts in Canada as needed—anywherefrom $2,000 to $5,000 to $10,000, apparently. Following separation, the applicant continued touse the account in this manner but also started using it to send money to the parties’ daughterEileen who was then going to school in the United States.

[12] While the respondent may have been on the account as one of the owners, from theevidence, the account was controlled by the applicant and his sister. While used to pay expensesrelated to the California property, such as insurance, taxes and the mortgage, it was also used topay for the applicant and his sister’s mother’s support and her living expenses. It was alsofunded, to a great extent, by the applicant from his personal accounts. For all intents andpurposes it was the applicant’s account and should be credited to him.
California Property

[13] The parties bought a house on Gardenia Avenue, Fountain Valley, California, as jointtenants in March, 1994 for US$235,000. They sold it in June, 2016, for US$736,000.

[14] The applicant alleges that he and his wife used US$25,000 from his sister, Kiem Thi Bui
(“Kiem”), in order to purchase the house and agreed to repay her and her husband when it wassold based upon a share of the profits and a “management fee” based upon the selling price.
Based upon the alleged agreement the applicant says he owes Kiem US$98,550 or $126,115.75,which should be a debt for him on separation.

[15]

The respondent denies any such agreement.

[16] I accept the respondent’s position. I am not satisfied that there was an agreement betweenthe parties and Kiem and her husband as alleged.

[17] Kiem is the applicant’s older sister. She currently works as a pharmacist and lives in theUnited States, although, she did live and work in Canada for a time between 1998 and 2000.

[18] Kiem’s evidence is that when she arrived in the United States from Vietnam in 1993, shehad a lot of cash on her. She initially testified that she gave US$31,000 of this to the respondentto keep for her. This number later changed to US$37,000. Ultimately, Kiem could not rememberwhich amount it was. She testified that she gave the money to the applicant. Then she testifiedthat she gave it to both the applicant and respondent together. There was no record supporting

[10] Of the two positions presented, it should be attributed to the applicant, rather than bedivided equally between the parties.

[19] According to Kiem, the parties visited her and her husband in California in October,1993. She was living in a rental and was looking for a house to own. She initially testified thatshe found the Gardenia property and made an offer on it without the parties’ knowledge. Shethen changed her testimony and said that the four of them, her, her husband and the parties foundthe Gardenia property.

[20] Kiem testified that the four of them agreed that the applicant and the respondent wouldfinance the purchase, she would contribute US$ 25,000, towards the downpayment, her familywould live there or rent it out, she would pay $1,000 per month regardless of whether her familyused it or not and she would manage and repair the property as needed. In return, when theproperty was sold, she and her husband would be paid a “management fee” and a proportionateshare of the profits.

[21] The agreement was allegedly put into writing by Kiem, signed by her and sent to theapplicant in March, 1994, following a telephone conversation between herself and therespondent, who Kiem testified agreed to its terms. A copy of the document and its translation,by the applicant, was marked as Exhibit A3, Tab 6C.

[22] The applicant testified that he initialed the agreement and it then sat on a table in theirhouse for a long time. He testified that he thought the respondent initialed it too. The exhibitdoes not have the respondent’s initials on it.

[23] The respondent testified that: she was never given any money by Kiem, she was neverpart of a discussion about Kiem and her husband having any sort of interest in the Gardeniaproperty, she never had the telephone conversation with Kiem about the document, she neversaw the document in 1994, and the first time she saw the alleged agreement was during thecourse of the current litigation and just prior to trial. I note that the exhibit indicates it was faxedon April 13, 2016. The respondent did testify that Kiem at one point had wanted to buy half ofthe Gardenia property, but she had no money to do so as the money she did have was needed byher for her studies and in trying to become licensed as a pharmacist in the United States.

[24] Having considered all of the evidence about the California property, I have considerabledifficulty in accepting much of Kiem’s evidence as reliable. For example, her evidenceconstantly changed both during her examination in chief and in cross-examination. She could notremember how much money she handed over to whom, yet she was able to remember telephoneconversations that took place in 1994. She gave answers to questions that were not asked of herand refused to answer straightforward questions with straightforward answers.

[25] Although allegedly managing the property, she had no records of leases, tenants, rents ormaintenance repairs. There was no evidence as to how much rent she collected or where it went.
There were no lease documents. There was no accounting from 1994 to 2016 with respect to the

this testimony, either that she had these funds or that she gave some amount to the applicant or toboth of them to keep for her.

property. She knew nothing about comparable or market rent in California. She knew nothingabout the landlord and tenant laws in California. Her dates as to when the property was occupiedby her family constantly changed as did who was there and at what times and the number oftenants, what the rent was and when tenants were there. Although she lived in Canada for twoyears, she allegedly still managed the property. When she was in Florida, she allegedly stillmanaged the property. As she flippantly responded, she was a pharmacist, so managing theproperty was easy.

[26] The applicant’s evidence regarding the California property was also problematic andunreliable. If Kiem was paying $1,000 per month, the applicant never accounted for this on histax returns. He still claimed all the maintenance costs on his tax returns. He attempted to explainthis by saying Kiem was to cover small maintenance items and he was to cover largemaintenance items. The alleged agreement does not say this. The alleged agreement was neversigned by the respondent. The applicant, in turn, only initialed it. As he explained, he haddifferent signatures depending upon the importance of the document. If important, he signed itwith his full signature. The applicant testified that the alleged agreement was only 5 out of 10 inimportance, so he chose to only initial it.

[27] Whatever the agreement may have been between Kiem and the applicant, I am unable tofind that there was an agreement which entitled Kiem to US$98,550 or $126,115.75, as arguedby the applicant. I find that there is no debt owing to Kiem by the applicant or by the applicantand the respondent. Nor is half of this amount owing to Kiem by the applicant, as was argued inclosing submissions by the applicant.
Personal Loans to Respondent

[28] The respondent claims that as at the date of separation, August 31, 2013, she owed hersister, Thao Nguyen, $15,000, her brother, Minh Nguyen, $50,000, her mother, Von Tran,
$13,500 and her neighbor, Maria Manicone, $15,000.

[29] In support of this she produced copies of a number of cheques from her sister that predated August 31, 2013, a copy of a charge dated April 29, 1991 in the amount of $26,000 in herbrother’s name on a property in Mississauga which she says was then lent to her so that shecould buy the Stanley property on April 29, 1991, a copy of a cheque from her neighbour and acopy of a cheque to her neighbor that both pre-dated August 31, 2013. She also produced copiesof a number of cheques from her sister that were all subsequent to the date of separation.

[30]

The respondent had the onus to prove that these were debts owing. She failed to do so.

[31] There was no evidence beyond copies of the various cheques and the charge. There wereno loan documents, no letter or even an email supporting a loan for any of the alleged loans.
There was no evidence of any demands. There was no accounting or calculation as to how theloan amounts were arrived at. None of the creditors were called as witnesses. There was noevidence that they could not be called as witnesses. While the respondent claimed she had repaid

[32] The evidence produced to substantiate the loans was insufficient. I find that the personalloans for the purposes of equalization should be zero dollars.
Honda Prelude

[33] At the date of marriage in April, 1993, the parties agree that the respondent owned a 1988
Honda Prelude. They disagree over its value. The applicant argues that it was worth $10,000.
The respondent argues it was worth $26,000.

[34] There was no evidence presented by the respondent as to the value of a 1988 HondaPrelude in 1993 nor was there evidence as to the value of her specific vehicle. It was her onus todo so if she was seeking a valuation greater than the $10,000 admitted by the applicant.
Accordingly, the valuation of $10,000 is appropriate.
RRSP

[35] At the date of marriage in April, 1993, the respondent claims that she owned an RRSP
worth $37,500. The applicant argues that there is no evidence of this, so the value should be $0.

[36] There is no evidence on this. The respondent argues that the evidence of this was eitherdestroyed by the applicant or was lost when her car, containing her financial records, was stolenand never recovered. She alleges that funds from her RRSP were used to purchase the cottageproperty on Fothergill Island, which is jointly held.

[37] The cottage was bought in June, 1992 for $166,100 and the parties took out a mortgagefor $120,000. While she may have used money from her RRSP to help purchase the cottage inJune, 1992, there is no evidence to substantiate the amount of her RRSP in April, 1993. I am notprepared, without more in support, to simply accept the respondent’s statement that she had
$37,500 in April, 1993, in an RRSP.
Income and Spousal Support

[38] The applicant submits that I should impute an income of $20,000 to the respondent forsupport purposes. This is less than minimum wage.

[39] The respondent is currently 56 years old. She is an intelligent individual. She arrived inCanada in 1980. She obtained her Grade 13 diploma and soon after obtained a diploma inengineering from Sheridan College after three years. She worked in a number of jobs and by1987 was working for a computer company in Ottawa. She left it in June, 1991 to live with theapplicant. They married April, 1993. She worked for a number of years as a bookkeeper in theapplicant’s practice. She is currently enrolled in a one-year accounting and payroll administrator

some of the loans, other than the copy of the one cheque to her neighbor, there was no evidencethat the respondent even acknowledged these loans.

program at the Canadian Business College, which will qualify her to be a bookkeeper. Upongraduation, the College will assist her in finding employment. She expects to earn $11 to $12 perhour.

[40] An imputed income of $20,000 was not seriously challenged by the respondent. In fact,she provided SSAG calculations where she inputted an income of $24,000 for herself. Basedupon the time she has been out of the workforce, her anticipated hourly wage and her age, I find
$20,000 to be an appropriate number for her, as suggested by the applicant.

[41] The applicant works as a general practitioner. He has a solo practice. In 2013 he set up aprofessional corporation for the purposes of running his practice. He started using his corporationin 2014.

[42] Up until 2010, when the respondent was fired from the applicant’s medical practice, theparties aggressively income split in order to minimize the overall tax liability for the family. Thischanged in 2011 when the applicant started splitting income by allegedly employing his childrenalthough Eileen, in giving her evidence, stated that she did not know how much she was paid,how she was paid or where her alleged employment income went. The applicant claimed that hischildren were tasked not only with clerical duties such as filing and charting and the scanningand shredding of old files and charts but also with reviewing patients’ charts and providingtreatment diagnoses. In his view his children had received training for the provision of medicaldiagnoses through talks at home. In recent years the payment to his children averaged between
$30,000 - $31,000 per year.

[43] As well, over the years the respondent has been able to minimize his reported line 150
income through rental losses arising from the cottage property, the Stanley property and theCalifornia property, by claiming expenses over and above the income generated by them andsetting this off against his professional income.

[44] He also testified that his income had decreased over the years as he was getting older andcouldn’t see as many patients. Currently he is 64 years old. He listed a variety of medicalailments that he claimed to have, which he said prevented him from working as much as he hadin the past. There was no independent evidence of any of this. He also claimed that he wassuffering from sleep deprivation, due to him sleeping in a hammock in the basement of thematrimonial home, rather than a bed, which resulted in a loss of energy. Again, there was noindependent evidence of him suffering from sleep deprivation. He claimed that he had beensleeping this way and suffering since separation. Why he continued to do so since August, 2013,rather than buying himself a bed, to alleviate his alleged sleep problems, if they did actuallyexist, was unexplained.

[45] The applicant’s line 150 income bears little relationship to the family lifestyle. Thematrimonial home has over $1,000,000 in equity. The parties own a cottage with no debt, and arental property with minimal debt. They owned a California property for over 20 years whichwas sold for US$736,000. He owns an office property with no debt. The applicant has sizeable

RRSPs. In 2013 he bought a luxury car for $79,000, although he described it as an average car. Itis financed. The parties have three children in university. The applicant obtained lines of credittotaling $300,000, with apparently little problem, to finance Eileen’s medical school. Heprepared a list of expenses for his children for 2013 and 2014 which was put in as an exhibit attrial. His grand total of children’s expenses alone, for these two years, came to almost $188,000,whereas his claimed line 150 income for 2013 was $129,196 and in 2014 was $49,635 alongwith a net corporate income of $66,145 for a total of $115,780.

[46] The applicant argues that I should impute an income of $140,808 for support purposes byadding back the salaries allegedly paid to his children to his 2015 income of $94,022 and thenrounding the figure up.

[47] At the commencement of trial the respondent submitted that I should impute an incomeof $140,000 to $180,000 to the applicant for 2015. By the conclusion of the trial the respondentsubmitted that I should impute an income of $247,000 for 2015 by adding together $60,000 paidto his children, equity in his corporation of $98,806, rent for the Gerrard St. East property of
$27,000 and wages to himself of $62,000. I cannot accept an imputed income figure of $247,000.

[48] Other than the issue of rent and the children’s salaries none of this was put to theapplicant in cross-examination. Moreover, there was no explanation by the respondent as towhere the wage figure of $62,000 for the applicant came from or why it differed from the agreedupon income for 2015, which was in fact higher. Nor was there evidence as to why the equity inthe corporation should be imputed as income. If the respondent was seeking to impute an incomeof $247,000 to the applicant, this should have been done.

[49] As well, the wages attributed to his children were $31,000 not $60,000. There was noevidence of $60,000. While the rent amount, which in 2015 was $30,846 and not $27,000, wasacknowledged by the applicant to be an imaginary number, as it was not actually paid, there wasno evidence from the respondent to suggest that it was not based upon market rent. If notoccupying his own building the applicant would have had to pay someone else rent, which wouldhave been a valid expense.

[50] If a party wishes to impute an income figure to another party it is incumbent upon themto provide evidence in support, especially in a situation such as this where an individual is usinga corporation to apparently attempt to minimize his income. This can be done through expertevidence or at the very least put as propositions to the other side.

[51] However, in my view I am able, on the evidence before me, to impute an income to theapplicant. It differs from the suggested figures of $140,808 or $247,000. In doing so I haveconsidered the criteria set out in sections 17 to 19 of the Ontario Child Support Guidelines, O.
Reg. 391/97.

[52] From the applicant’s tax returns filed in evidence the applicant’s revenue from OHIP
from 2011 to 2013 was $321,858, $320,702 and $331,521. I have not considered 2014 as this

was the first year of incorporation which had the effect of dramatically and artificially reducinghis income although his revenue from OHIP was still high at $309,528. This is also the case for2015. There was also no credible explanation from the applicant as to why his OHIP revenue for2015 was reduced. As mentioned previously I do not accept his evidence of medical ailments orlack of energy. I find the figures for 2014 and 2015 to be irrelevant for the calculation of theapplicant’s income. The three years from 2011 to 2013 average $324,693 in revenue.

[53] These billings and revenue from OHIP generated a professional income of $154,482,
$153,101 and $144,271 for an average of $150,618. I consider the professional income to be amore appropriate figure to use than the applicant’s line 150 income as the line 150 incomeincludes his claimed rental losses from the cottage, the Stanley property and the Californiaproperty. Of these the Stanley property is the only true rental property. Moreover, theseproperties have either been sold or will soon be sold and will no longer be a consideration.

[54] In arriving at the applicant’s professional income for these three years I believe that theapplicant has made unreasonable deductions. He has deducted alleged wages to his children, of
$15,944, $36,504 and $36,504 for an average of $29,651. For these years only Eileen wasclaimed as an employee. Eileen testified that she did in fact work for her father although, asmentioned previously, she did not know how much she was paid, how she was paid or where herpay went. While no questions were asked of her as to when she worked or how much sheworked, being a student at McGill during these years meant she could only work during thesummer. Assuming 16 weeks of work at 35 hours per week and a generous wage of $15 per hourfor clerical work, this amounts to $8,400. I consider the average deduction of $29,651 to beunreasonable and excessive and I add back $21,000 to the applicant’s average professionalincome of $150,618.

[55] I also question the applicant’s deductions of expenses for meals and entertainment andhis claimed automobile expenses. His meals and entertainment expenses for 2011 to 2013 were
$5,505, $7,287, and $9,579, respectively. In cross-examination when questioned about his mealexpenses for 2014 and why the claimed number of $11,174 was so high the applicant answeredthat he required a lot of corporate meetings, and needed to meet weekly to review the work of thecorporation with the other directors of the corporation – his two children, Eileen and Alan.
Eileen was at McGill in 2014 so weekly meetings with her would have been impossible. Alanwas in Toronto and living at home. While this was for 2014, following incorporation of theapplicant’s practice, I believe that this response represents the applicant’s approach to his taxfilings and his claiming of deductions in general and for the years 2011 to 2013. His autoexpenses for these three years were $15,732, $11,631 and $14,221. Being a busy solepractitioner working at one location it is difficult to imagine how his auto expenses could be sohigh when travel between his business and his house is not claimable as an expense. For thepurposes of imputing income I add a further $10,000 to his average professional income, inrelation to unreasonable deductions for meals, entertainment and auto expenses for a total of
$181,618 which I will round up to $182,000.

[56] The applicant is not seeking child support from the respondent for Albert. Nor will he beseeking child support for Albert in the future on the assumption that Albert will be living withhim. Albert will soon be 17. He can decide where he wishes to live. The applicant is to haveexclusive possession at Laurel Avenue, where Albert currently resides, as he is the sole owner ofthe matrimonial home and once the divorce is granted, which divorce the respondent agreed toduring her closing argument, the respondent’s rights to possession of the matrimonial home willend. The respondent made no claim to the matrimonial home.

[57] The parties agree that the respondent is entitled to spousal support. They also agree thatno retroactive support is owing. They further agree that the mid-point of the Spousal SupportAdvisory Guidelines is appropriate. The parties are to use the income figures of $182,000 for theapplicant and $20,000 for the respondent. Support is to commence on the first day of the monthfollowing the month in which my reasons are released. The parties shall calculate the spousalsupport based upon the above inputs and incorporate that number in a draft order.

[58]

A support deduction order is to issue.

Section 7 Expenses

[59] The parties shall share s. 7 expenses proportionate to their incomes. The only expenseswhich are at issue are the education costs for Alan, Edward and Albert. Neither party seeks any s.
7 expenses in relation to Eileen.

[60] The parties have a RESP account for the children. Its current value is approximately
$158,345. The applicant’s evidence was that Alan’s current educational costs are about $20,000
per year, Edward’s about $22,000 to $23,000 per year and Albert’s, because he is in high school,are currently nothing. None of this was contradicted by the respondent. All of the children areacademically gifted. In all likelihood they will all be in post-graduate studies of some sort. Bothparents want to assist their children as much as they can.

[61] The applicant seeks an order that Alan’s, Edward’s and Albert’s annual post-secondaryeducation costs be paid with the first $15,000 for each being paid from the RESP and the balancebeing shared 78% and 22% by the applicant and respondent. There was no explanation as to howthese percentages were arrived at.

[62] The respondent did not provide a draft order with her suggestion as to the s. 7 expenses.
She did argue that s. 7 expenses do not exist as not only is there the RESP, the children alsoreceive scholarships. Her evidence was that Edward received an $8,500 scholarship in his firstyear at Waterloo. This was not disputed. There was no evidence about Alan obtaining ascholarship.

[63] If any of Alan, Edward or Albert receives a scholarship that is to be deducted from theirpost-secondary school education costs. Thereafter, the education costs are to be paid up to amaximum of $15,000 per year, for each boy, as required, from the RESP. If there are any

education costs remaining they are to be paid, for the time being, until further adjustment,proportionally based upon the parties’ incomes, with the applicant paying 90% of the balanceand the respondent 10% of the balance based upon their respective incomes of $182,000 and
$20,000.

[64] The applicant shall provide the respondent with a complete written accounting for each ofthe boys setting out their respective educational costs, any scholarships received, the RESP
withdrawals and the proportional share outstanding for each of the parties, with appropriate backup documentation, before any amount is due and payable by the respondent.

[65]

A support deduction order is to issue.

Right of First Refusal for the Stanley Avenue Property

[66] The Stanley Avenue property in Mimico was bought in April, 1991 by the respondent. InSeptember, 1994 after their marriage in April, 1993, it was transferred to the applicant andrespondent as joint tenants. The consideration was for natural love and affection. It was done,according to the respondent, at the suggestion of the applicant’s brother as well as their jointaccountant.

[67] At the commencement of trial the respondent took the position that it should not be soldand should be placed in her name alone, for equalization purposes. By the end of the trial sheacknowledged that it was held jointly and should be sold.

[68] However, during closing arguments the respondent asked for an order that she have aright of first refusal on any offer for Stanley. This was opposed by the applicant.

[69] Stanley has three rental units. The respondent wishes to live in one of the units and to rentout the other two. Because she is familiar with the property and its maintenance she would ratherpurchase Stanley than some other rental property where she could have the same sort ofarrangement.

[70] I am not prepared to grant a right of first refusal to the respondent. It is unfair to raise thisduring closing argument. The parties agreed to a valuation process for Stanley before JusticeHorkins in April, 2014 for the purposes of determining the value of the properties for eachparty’s net family property calculation. They each obtained an appraisal. The appraisals werefiled as part of the trial record. A right of first refusal was not considered by either appraiser.
Each appraiser appraised Stanley on the basis of its market value. Market value is a defined term.
Among other things, it assumes a competitive and open market, with the buyer actingknowledgeably and being well informed.

[71] The parties, in reliance upon the two appraisals, agreed to value Stanley at the midpointbetween them. If the respondent wanted a right of first refusal it should have been part of theappraisals.

[72] In my view, any right of first refusal would have a negative impact upon the sale price ofStanley on the open market. It creates uncertainty for any potential buyer. Uncertainty impactsprice. A potential buyer may be unwilling to put forward his or her best offer knowing that itcould be trumped by the respondent. There could also be less potential buyers as they might notwish to incur the costs associated with putting together an offer and valuing a rental property,again knowing that it could be readily trumped.

[73] The respondent is free, if she wishes, to make her own offer or offers for Stanley oncelisted for sale.
Costs

[74]

I encourage the parties to try to reach an agreement on costs.

[75] If unable to do so, any party seeking costs may file brief written submissions, not toexceed three typed, double spaced pages, together with a Bill of Costs and any necessarydocuments, such as dockets and offers to settle, on or before June 6, 2017. Any replysubmissions subject to the same directions are to be filed within three weeks of service of theinitial submissions. In addition to filing their submissions as part of the continuing record theparties are also directed to provide a copy directly to Judges’ Administration, Room 170, at 361
University Avenue, to my attention.

Any reply submissions subjectto the same directions are to be filed within three weeks of service of the initialsubmissions. In addition to filing their submissions as part of the continuing record

5. Except as provided in this Order, each party shall retain all assets currently registeredin that party’s possession.

[77] I am not prepared to make the order sought by the Applicant in his draft order atparagraph 10 regarding material change and variation. There was no argument on this. Moreover,the order sought is hypothetical and presupposes too much. The parties have their rights underthe Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) and the Family Law Act.
