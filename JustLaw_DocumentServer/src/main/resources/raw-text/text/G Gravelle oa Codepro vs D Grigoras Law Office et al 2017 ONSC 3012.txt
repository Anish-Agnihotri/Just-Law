-2-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BackgroundThe Plaintiff entered into an agreement with a purchaser (Kaba IIco Corp. and Chuck

Murray) on November 14, 2006. In March 2008 the Plaintiff retained the Defendants DenisGrigoras and his law firm Denis Grigoras Law Office, to represent him to assist in negotiatingvarious disputes that had arisen under that agreement. Part of the negotiations resulted in asettlement that contained a clause requiring the parties to go to binding arbitration to resolve anyfuture disputes under the agreement in North Carolina. A settlement agreement was entered intoon April 22, 2008 with the binding arbitration clause as part of the agreement.

[5]

The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant, Denis Grigoras advised him that the arbitration

clause was unenforceable in the United States when in fact it was enforceable in the State ofNorth Carolina. He also alleges that Mr. Grigoras was not qualified to provide legal advice onthe laws of North Carolina where he was not licenced.

[6]

In November 2008 the Plaintiff commenced an action against the Purchaser in the

Ontario Superior Court in Thunder Bay with respect to other disputes that had arisen and in thataction he sought to have the arbitration clause declared unenforceable.

[7]

The Plaintiff`s evidence was that at his request, Mr. Grigoras reviewed the statement of

claim for the November 2008 action and provided him with suggested revisions. The Plaintiffalleges that at that point, Mr. Grigoras should have informed him that he could not pursue hislegal action against the Purchaser because the binding arbitration clause was a valid clause. ThePlaintiff claims that Mr. Grigoras also had an obligation to inform him that he had providedincorrect legal advice to the Plaintiff in 2006 regarding the enforceability of the arbitration clausein the settlement agreement.

[8]

The Plaintiff claims that Mr. Grigoras continued to advise him throughout 2008 that he

had a strong argument in favour of having the arbitration clause declared unenforceable and bydoing so, he prevented the Plaintiff from discovering the errors and negligent advice he hadreceived from Mr. Grigoras in 2006 regarding the enforceability of the arbitration clause.

In March 2009 the Plaintiff’s Thunder Bay action against the Purchaser was dismissed

attend binding arbitration.

[10]

In June 2009 the Plaintiff retained a new lawyer, Barry Leon to pursue his claims against

the Purchaser. A new statement of claim was issued on September 23, 2010 against thePurchaser, seeking in part to declare the arbitration clause unenforceable. The Purchaser movedto have this second action stayed in favour of requiring the parties to attend binding arbitration inNorth Carolina as per the settlement agreement.

[11]

On October 11, 2011, the Plaintiff decided to abandon his claim against the Purchaser

and stipulated that he would enter into binding arbitration in North Carolina with the Purchaseras per the settlement agreement. The civil action was permanently stayed.

[12]

In December 2012, after hearing from the parties during binding arbitration, the arbitrator

found in favour of the Purchaser. The Plaintiff sought reconsideration of the arbitrator’s decision;however he learned that arbitration rules in North Carolina do not permit reconsideration. Assuch, the Plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Federal Court and was unsuccessful. The Federal Court ofAppeal decision was rendered in September 2012.

[13]

The Plaintiff now seeks compensation from the Defendants for lost business profits as a

result of the unsuccessful arbitration as well as legal fees he incurred throughout the history ofthe litigation against the Purchaser regarding the settlement agreement and subsequent disputes.

[14]

The Defendants deny liability for all of the Plaintiff’s claims. They also allege that the

Plaintiff’s claims are statute barred by virtue of s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002, which providesa two year limitation period as follows:
“Unless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not be commenced inrespect of a claim after the second anniversary of the day on which the claim wasdiscovered.”

without prejudice. The Purchaser had opposed the action and sought to compel the Plaintiff to

It is the position of the Defendants that the two year limitation period began to run on

ended with the following statement by the Plaintiff:
In the matter of Gravelle v. Kaba ILCO, you failed to advise me on the exorbitant costsassociated with binding arbitration...[and] you expressly gave me consent to file a lawsuitbearing your firms [sic] name, then subsequently engaged in reprehensible misconductwhich was highly prejudicial to my position, by falsely claiming to both the court and toopposing counsel, the [sic] you never authorized me to file the issued claim...

[16]

The Plaintiff had commenced an action against the Defendants in late 2009 being court

file number CV-09-550 claiming the Defendants were negligent regarding their advice on anunrelated matter. On March 24, 2010, the Plaintiff sought the consent of counsel for theDefendants in that action to amend the statement of claim to include the allegations ofnegligence regarding the North Carolina arbitration clause. The pleadings were never amendedand that action was eventually dismissed for delay on July 26, 2012.
Law and Analysis

[17]

The Defendants claim that the Plaintiff has missed the two year limitation period in

which he should have commenced an action against the Defendants and having failed tocommence his action in that period, the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.

[18]

The Plaintiff argued that the limitation period did not begin to run until October 11,

2011at the earliest, which was the date upon which he stipulated that he would enter into bindingarbitration in North Carolina and his civil action against the Purchaser was stayed.

[19]

A court must grant summary judgment if it is satisfied that there is no genuine issue

requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence (Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, Reg194, r 20.04(2)(a); Hryniak v Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, at para 47 [Hryniak]).

[20]

There is no genuine issue requiring a trial where the judge is able to reach a fair and just

determination on the merits on a motion for summary judgment.

When the process allows the

judge to make the necessary findings of fact, to apply the law to those facts, and it is a

November 23, 2009 when the Plaintiff wrote to Mr. Grigoras alleging misconduct. The letter

-5-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just result, summary

[21]

In determining whether or not there is no genuine issue requiring a trial, a court shall

consider the evidence presented by the parties on the summary judgment motion. A judge mayalso weigh evidence, evaluate the credibility of a deponent and draw any reasonable inferencefrom the evidence, unless it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercised only attrial (Rules of Civil Procedure, r 20.04(2.1); Hryniak at para 52).

[22]

In determining whether to apply Rule 20.04(2.1), the judge should determine whether a

full appreciation of the evidence and issues required to make a dispositive finding can beachieved by way of summary judgment, without a trial. The evidence need not be equivalent tothat expected at trial, but the judge must be confident that the dispute can be resolved fairly
(Hryniak, at paras 53, 57).

[23]

There is no dispute that the limitation period to commence an action against the

Defendants was two years. The question before the court on this summary judgment motion iswhether or not the provisions of s. 5 of the Limitations Act were satisfied. Section 5 sets out thefactors to be considered when ascertaining when a claim was or should have been known to aplaintiff:
5.(1)

A claim is discovered on the earlier of,

(a) the day on which the person with the claim first knew,
(i) that the injury, loss or damage had occurred,
(ii) that the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act oromission,
(iii) that the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim ismade, and
(iv) that, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, aproceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and

judgment is the appropriate remedy (Hryniak at para 49).

-6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2)
A person with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred toin clause (1) (a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took place,unless the contrary is proved.

[24]

The evidence before me on this summary judgment motion supports the Defendants’

position that the Plaintiff had discovered his claim against the Defendants more than two yearsprior to the date upon which the Plaintiff commenced this action on October 4, 2013.

[25]

The Plaintiff’s argument was that even though he believed the advice he received

regarding the arbitration clause was negligent as early as 2009; that because he also believed thathis litigation against the Purchaser to set aside the settlement agreement had a strong probabilityof success, which created the likelihood he would not need to sue the Defendants, the limitationperiod as against the Defendants did not start to run until he withdrew from the litigation andagreed to binding arbitration on October 11, 2011.

[26]

However, as already noted, on November 23, 2009 the Plaintiff wrote to the Defendant,

Denis Grigoras with a subject line: Notice of Pending Legal Malpractice Action. In that letter thePlaintiff commented on the exorbitant costs associated with binding arbitration and threatened tosue the Defendants if his claim with the Purchaser did not settle and informed them to put theirinsurer on notice.

[27]

This letter was followed by the letter on March 24, 2010 in which the Plaintiff sought to

amend pleadings against the Defendants in an unrelated proceeding to include negligence claimsregarding their failure to properly inform him about binding arbitration clauses in contractsinterpreted under the laws of North Carolina.

[28]

I find that by virtue of this evidence, the Plaintiff had discovered that he had a claim

against the Defendants by November 23, 2009. The fact that the Plaintiff chose to continue topursue his law suit against the Purchaser to set aside the settlement agreement, believing hewould be successful does not stop the limitation period from running as against the Defendants.

(b) the day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances ofthe person with the claim first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause
(a).

Court File No: CV-13-0370-00

-7-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[29]

I therefore find that the limitation period began to run on November 23, 2009 and as such

November 22, 2011 in order to comply with the provisions of s. 4 of the Limitation Act. ThePlaintiff’s action, commence on October 4, 2013 is therefore statute barred and shall bedismissed.
Costs

[30]

The Defendants are entitled to their costs of this motion. If the parties are unable to

resolve the issue of costs between themselves, they shall file written submissions on costs within30 days of this decision. The submissions shall not exceed 5 pages.
