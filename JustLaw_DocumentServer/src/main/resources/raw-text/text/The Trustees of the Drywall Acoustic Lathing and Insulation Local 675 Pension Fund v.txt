PERELL, J.
REASONS FOR DECISION - COSTS

[1]
This is a costs decision after the hearing of an omnibus motion (eight motions heardtogether) in this billion-dollar misrepresentation in the secondary market securities class action.

[2]
The result of the omnibus motion was that: (a) I granted the Outside Directors’ motion tostrike paragraphs 15(e) and 16 from the Plaintiffs’ Amended Reply without leave to amend; (b) I
dismissed the Plaintiffs’ motion to deliver a Fresh as Amended Reply; (c) I granted the OutsideDirectors’ and Mr. Novak’s respective motions to strike paragraphs 20 to 41 from Mr. BenAïssa’s Statement of Defence without leave to amend; (d) I made protective orders with respectto the examinations for discovery of Messrs. Ben Aïssa, Duhaime, and Roy; and (e) I made noorders to stay or postpone the examinations for discovery. See The Trustees of the Drywall AcousticLathing and Insulation Local 675 Pension Fund v. SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., 2017 ONSC 2188.

2

[4]
SNC-Lavalin and the Outside Directors submit that the costs should be payable to themin any event of the cause and more appropriately forthwith. They claim costs of $42,597.44, allinclusive, from the Plaintiffs, and costs of $25,663.45, all inclusive, from Mr. Ben Aïssa.

[5]
Not surprisingly, the Plaintiffs and Mr. Ben Aïssa submit that the appropriate order is tomake costs in the cause. In the alternative, they make a host of arguments challenging thequantum of the costs being claimed.

[6]
Having read the costs submissions of the parties, I am convinced that the appropriate andfairest award in all the circumstances is costs in the cause.

[7]
Although I did not mention it in my Reasons for Decision, before suggesting that costs inthe cause was the appropriate order, I had reflected that in all the circumstances of the omnibusmotion and of the action, the fairest order would be no order as to costs. I reflected that such anorder would better correspond to the omnibus nature of the hearing and of its divided outcome,where not only was success divided, but on some issues, success was diminished from theaspirations of the successful party.

[8]
Further, as I did note in my Reasons for Decision, many of the issues explored on theomnibus motion were the novel issues in the unchartered legal territory of the secondary marketcauses of action under the Ontario Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5. The circumstance ofexploring novel legal issues is a basis upon which judges may exercise their discretion toexpressly make no order as to costs.

[9]
However, notwithstanding these reflections that would justify making no order as tocosts, I ultimately suggested that costs in the cause was the appropriate order.

[10] I made this suggestion because I felt that the omnibus motion was part of the fabric of thewhole litigation and if a party ultimately succeeded in the whole litigation then win, lose, or drawon the various branches of the omnibus motion, the victorious party in the action should be ableto claim costs for the interlocutory motion. Put somewhat differently, if I picked a winner for theomnibus motion and made the losers pay costs but the winner ultimately failed in the overalllitigation, then it would be unfair and unjust that the party that won the battle but lost the warshould receive costs from the ultimate victor of the case.

[11] I remain of the view that the appropriate award in all the circumstances is costs in thecause.

I concluded my Reasons for Decision by suggesting that the appropriate order was tomake the costs of all the motions, costs in the cause but that if any of the parties disagreed, thenthey could apply for costs.
