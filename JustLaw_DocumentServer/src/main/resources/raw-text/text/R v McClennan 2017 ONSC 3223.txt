[On appeal from the judgment of J. Douglas J. dated April 25, 2016]

[2]

To succeed the Appellant must prove that the trial judge made a palpable

enough that I may have a difference of opinion with the trial judge (R. v. Gagnon

[2006] S.C.J. No. 17).

[3]

A high degree of deference is owed to the trial judge. As noted in R. v.

R.E.M. [2008] 3 SCR 3, at page 32, “Deference is in order and intervention willbe rare.”

[4]

At the commencement of the trial it was agreed that the only issue was

whether or not the Appellant, who was impaired and found sitting in the driver’sseat of

his vehicle,

wearing his seatbelt, and with the engine running,

represented an inherent risk of danger in relation to whether or not he would puthis vehicle in motion.

[5]

Section 258(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, in such situations,

dictates that an accused shall be deemed to have had care and control of thevehicle unless the accused establishes that he did not occupy the driver’s seatfor the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion.

[6]

Counsel agree that the onus is on the Appellant, on a balance of

probabilities, to establish that the seat was not occupied with the intent of settingthe vehicle in motion.

and overriding error in regards to his findings of facts and credibility. It is not

FACTS
The Appellant testified at this trial. He said that on the day in question he

had travelled to Palmerston for a dental appointment. Thereafter he went to theliquor store and bought two bottles of wine for the next day, Valentine’s Day,which he was spending with his girlfriend. He then visited a friend with whom heconsumed two bottles of beer.

[8]

The Appellant left his friend’s house and went to the home of Mary Burt,

another friend. He had nothing to drink at her home. In the early evening he lefther home to travel home to Elora, a trip which in good weather takes 20 minutes.

[9]

The Appellant testified that the weather was very bad. It was a very cold

evening and there was blowing snow which in his opinion made further drivingunsafe. His evidence of the weather conditions that night were, for the most partconfirmed. The Appellant decided it was too dangerous to drive and pulled into alaneway to park his vehicle for the night. It was, he testified, his intention toremain in the car and stay there for the night.

[10]

The Appellant then decided to open the wine and using a wine glass

given to him by Ms. Burt for use on Valentine’s Day, consumed 11/2 bottles ofwine.

[11]

The Appellant testified that at some point he contacted his then girlfriend,

Catherine Grey, and told her he would not be home that night, telling her that she

might have to come and get him the next morning. He also called his daughter

[12]

The Appellant parked his vehicle in the laneway of rural property owned

by Adam Cosens. At some point Mr. Cosens noticed the Appellant’s car andwent to investigate. He found the Appellant, asleep in the driver’s seat, with theengine running and the radio on. Mr. Cosens had difficulty waking the Appellantand after returning to his house decided to call the police.

[13]

The police arrived and observed the same circumstances. An empty wine

glass was observed on the console between the two front seats.

[14]

The Appellant was arrested and taken in to custody. There is no issue

that he was impaired and that his blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit.

[15]

At trial and on this appeal, it is the Appellant’s position that he had no

intention of operating his vehicle after pulling it into the laneway and that heposed no realistic risk to others or himself.
THE LAW

[16]

The Supreme Court of Canada, in R. v. Boudreault [2012]3S.C.R. 157

was faced with a similar fact situation.

Mr. Boudreault was found in the driver’s

seat of his truck with the engine running while waiting for the arrival of a taxi cab.

Tess, and told her he’d not be home that night. Tess was a witness at the trial.

-5-

When the cab driver arrived he found Mr. Boudreault asleep and called the

[17]

At trial Mr. Boudreault explained that he turned his truck on for the heat.

[18]

The trial judge acquitted Mr. Boudreault finding there was no real risk of

danger. The Quebec Court of Appeal found that trial judge had erred andregistered a conviction.

[19]

The Supreme Court set aside the decision of the Appeal Court and

restored the acquittal. From paragraph 9, I quote,
“For the reasons that follow I have concluded that “care and control within themeaning of 253(1) of the Criminal Code, signifies (1) an intentional course ofconduct associated with a motor vehicle; (2) by a person whose ability to driveis impaired or whose blood alcohol level exceeds the legal limit; (3) incircumstances that create a realistic risk, as opposed to a remote possibility ofdanger to persons or property.

[20]

As in the case before me, it was the third element that was in issue. The

existence of a realistic risk is a matter of fact (para. 11).

[21]

From paragraph 12, I quote,
“I recognize, as the trial judge did, that a conviction will normally ensue wherethe accused, as in this case, was found inebriated behind the wheel of a motorvehicle with nothing to stop the accused from setting it in motion, eitherintentionally or accidentally.”

police.

[22]

A person’s ability to drive while impaired creates an inherent risk of

risk is not a realistic risk, in the circumstances of the case (para. 13).

[23]

From paragraph 37, I quote,
“Accordingly, an accused found in the driver’s seat will be presumed, as amatter of law, to have care and control of the vehicle, unless the accusedsatisfies the court that he or she had no intention to drive…”

[24]

An intention to set a vehicle in motion would create the risk of danger.

Even an inebriated person found behind the wheel, who has no present intentionto operate the vehicle may, nevertheless, present a realistic risk of danger (para.
41).

[25]

An inebriated person may change his or her mind, or unintentionally set

the vehicle in motion. Further, even a stationary vehicle may endanger the public
(para. 42).

[26]

From paragraph 45 I quote,
“As I mentioned at the outset, anyone found inebriated and behind the wheelwith a present ability to drive will - and should – almost invariably be convicted.
It hardly follows however, that a conviction in these circumstances is, or shouldbe, automatic. A conviction will be neither appropriate nor inevitable absent areal risk of danger in the particular circumstances of the case.”

[27]

Realistic risk is a low threshold. To avoid conviction an accused must

adduce credible and reliable evidence to prove that no such risk exists (para. 48).

danger. The Appellant must adduce evidence tending to prove that the inherent

ANALYSIS
With respect to the matter before me, the trial judge’s decision, and the

reasons therefore, commence at page 18 of the transcript of proceedings whichtook place on April 25, 2016. He reviews the evidence of the witnesses and atpage 21, in reference to the evidence of Ms. Burt states,
“As a matter of fact, she said he had nothing to drink, although he had testifiedthat he had a couple of beers.”

[29]

This quote would appear to be a misstatement of the evidence. It was the

testimony of Ms. Burt that the Appellant had nothing to drink while he was at herhome and that he was sober when he was in her home. The Appellant testifiedthat he had had the two beers before he visited Ms. Burt.

[30]

In my opinion the trial judge relied on this finding of fact in his

assessment of the issue of realistic risk and the credibility of the Appellant.

[31]

Another possible error can be found at page 9, line 28 of the April 25 th

transcript where J. Douglas J. opines, “The distinct impression is that had theweather improved, he would have driven the 20 minutes it took to get home.

[32]

Earlier in his ruling (page 23, l. 24), the trial judge quotes the evidence of

the of the Appellant as follows:
“In cross examination, he said, “I wasn’t going anywhere. The reason being, I
knew the police were coming.” “And if the weather improved?”, he was asked,
“Yes, I would’ve went home.”

[28]

[33]

This reference to the evidence had to have been taken from the following

page 56, line 23, of the transcript of February 8, 2016:

[34]

Q.

I’m suggesting to you that when you first pulled over, you had to bethinking the first opportunity I have to go home I’m going to go. I’m notgoing to stay here in the stranger’s driveway for the whole night. That –
wouldn’t make any sense, I’m suggesting.

A.

Right.

Q.

Do you agree with that?

A.

Yes, and no. if the weather – if the weather was better and that, yes, I
would have went home. But with my car in the condition and the weatherand the people coming out to the car, the timing, just – I knew it was notgood to drive so…

It seems to me to be an error to simply quote the Appellant saying, had

the weather improved he would have gone home.

[35]

Further, the excerpt from the evidence of the Appellant relied upon by the

trial judge, in his assessment of whether the accused posed a realistic risk, wastaken out of context.

[36]

From page 55, line 14, of the transcript of February 8, 2016, the following

questions and answers were recorded from the cross-examination of theAppellant:
Q.

And had the weather cleared up at some point you would have continueddriving to see her?

A.

No, sir. And the reason being I knew that the police were coming, so I
wasn’t going anywhere.

exchange between the Appellant and the Respondent, found commencing at

[38]

At line 29, the following is recorded,Q.

And if the weather conditions had improved, you wanted to go seeCatherine that night?

A.

No.

Q.

You didn’t want to see her that night?

A.

Well, no, it would have been nice, but I knew I wasn’t going anywhere,because I was drinking, and I knew the police were on their way, so I
wasn’t – I wasn’t going anywhere.

The phrase, “I would have went home”, taken in context, could have

represented the Appellant’s intent after parking his vehicle in the laneway andprior to his decision to drink the wine.

[39]

His finding of fact that the Appellant would have driven home had the

weather improved even after his consumption of the wine represents an error.

[40]

The Respondent submits that are two ways to approach the issue of care

and control. The first way is set out in section 258(1)(a) (old 253(1)), whichestablishes a statutory presumption. Pursuant to that route, as noted byFragomeni J. in R. v. Brzozowski [2013] O. J. No. 2483 (para 20-23), theRespondent need not prove a realistic risk. It is the burden of an accused toestablish, on a balance of probabilities that no such risk exists.

[41]

The second route is to establish that an accused is in defacto care and

control which was discussed in the Boudreault case cited previously.

[37]

[42]

For my purposes I am not sure of the relevance of the distinction. As at

prove, on a balance of probabilities that there is no realistic risk of danger to thepublic. Without such a risk there is no criminality.

[43]

The question now to be answered is whether these errors can be

considered palpable and overriding?

[44]

The issue to be determined by the trial judge, the issue of whether there

was a realistic risk, was fact driven. Therefore factual errors that go to the issuesof intent and realistic risk have greater significance.

[45]

The errors in his finding of facts as noted, go directly to the issue he had

to determine.

[46]

I accept that in considering the relevance of these errors I must consider

the totality of the evidence and that great deference is to be given to the findingsof fact made by the trial judge.

[47]

However, given the fact that the errors go directly to the one issue to be

determined, I find that the errors noted rise to the level of palpable andoverriding.
