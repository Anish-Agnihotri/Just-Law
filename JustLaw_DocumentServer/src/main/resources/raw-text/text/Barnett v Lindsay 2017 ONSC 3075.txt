RULING ON COSTS
JARVIS J.:

[1]

This Ruling deals with costs. On July 29, 2016 Reasons for Decision were released
(amended August 29, 2016) after a four-day trial. Submissions on costs were invited ifthe parties were unable to agree about them but, for reasons not entirely clear, the parties’
submissions were not provided to me until the week of May 8, 2017. Neither counselalerted the court beforehand about any delay concerns.

[2]

The mother seeks costs of $64,161.87 plus HST and pre-judgment interest of $3,293.39.
The father claims that he was the more successful party at trial and should be awardedtrial costs of $45,165.73 inclusive of disbursements and HST. Alternatively, if theparties’ success at trial was divided, then each party should bear his or her own costs.

NEWMARKET COURT FILE NO.: FC-14-47180-00
DATE: 20170525

[3]

The mother made three Offers to Settle, only two of which were compliant with FamilyLaw Rule1 18. The father made one such rule-compliant Offer.

[4]

The mother's first Offer was restricted to the property issues between the parties. It wascontained in an e-mail to the father dated June 18, 2014 before these proceedings startedand proposed that the father pay her $119,500 in full settlement of their property issues.
Her second and third Offers, respectively dated January 29, 2015 and October 15, 2015,proposed that the father pay her $230,000 and later $190,000, respectively. The thirdOffer also referenced the father's child support obligation, basing his qualifying childsupport income at a substantially higher level (i.e. $110,000) than acknowledged in hispleadings or to Canada Revenue Agency. The court accepted this level of income for thefather and a lower income for the mother than she proposed.

[5]

The father's Offer was dated November 11, 2015. It proposed an $80,000 propertysettlement to the mother and set-off child support based on his income of $94,000.

[6]

Both Offers contained detailed parenting provisions.

[7]

With the exception of the mother’s third Offer, in respect to which she was whollysuccessful on the issue of the parties’ qualifying incomes for child support determinationpurposes, there was divided success on the property issues. Even so, the amount awardedto the mother on the property issues was substantially greater than what the fatherproposed. The child and parent scheduling issues addressed in paragraphs [72] to [79] ofthe Reasons for Decision, while important to the parties, occupied comparatively little ofthe court’s time.

Law

[8]

As observed by the Court of Appeal in Serra v. Serra2 , modern costs rules are designed tofoster three fundamental purposes:
(1) to partially indemnify successful litigants for the cost oflitigation;
(2) to encourage settlement; and
(3) to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants.

The overall objective in determining costs is fixing an amount that the “court views as afair and reasonable amount that should be paid by the unsuccessful [party]”; Boucher v.
Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario3 . Since the primary objective of

Analysis

[12]

The “full recovery” costs sanction referenced in Family Law Rule 18 (4) applies to themother’s third Offer regarding the child support issues from and after October 15, 2015.
Rule 24 (6) applies where success is divided, as it was in this case dealing with theproperty issues. Viewed overall the mother was the more successful party.

[13]

Costs of these proceedings shall be considered as required by Rule 24 (11).

(a) Importance, Complexity or Difficulty of the Issues

[14]

The issues in this case were important to the parties but not unduly complex or difficult.

(5) In deciding whether a party has behaved reasonably orunreasonably, the court shall examine,

5

[15]

The father acted unreasonably.
He was not a credible witness, failed to providedisclosure ordered by the court, was dishonest in his reporting to Canada RevenueAgency and disobeyed an Order of Kaufman J. made April 8, 2015 with respect tomortgaging one of the properties without the mother's consent or court Order. Asobserved in paragraph [17] of the Reasons for Decision, the father's testimony was oftenimplausible, self-serving and contradicted by documentary evidence.

(c) The Lawyers Rates

[16]

Both counsel were experienced family lawyers.
and $300 for Ms. Brown) were reasonable.

Their hourly rates ($335 for Ms. Bruce

(d) Time Properly Spent

[17]

Counsel for both parties submitted Bills of Costs which, in each case, was little more thana summary of time and disbursements.

[18]

The mother's Bill was divided into two parts; the first described as “Pre-Offer” ($15,630
fees) and the second “Post-Offer” ($44,815 fees). It is likely that the second categoryreferred to the period after the mother's third Offer dated October 15, 2015 but that is notclear. While several descriptions of services were provided they were more in the natureof summaries. No, more informative, details were provided of time spent or steps takenin the case. Total time spent was slightly in excess of 228 hours, most of which appearsto have been incurred by counsel.

[19]

By comparison, the father's counsel recorded 115 hours of time spent. The fathercontends that the mother's claim for $64,161.87 costs is excessive for what was for allpractical purposes a two and a half day trial involving five witnesses.
This issubstantially more than his costs of $45,165.73. I agree that the mother's claim isexcessive but note that her evidence in chief was tendered by affidavit which reducedoverall trial time.

[20]

In light of the absence of greater detail from the Bills of Costs it is neither desirable noreven possible in this case to more critically assess the costs applicable to each step takenin this case. As observed by Aston J. in Delellis v. Delellis6 ,

[95] It is important to reiterate that when the court is fixing costs, itis not undertaking a simple mechanical exercise. Such an exercise

6

Delellis v. Delellis, [2005] O.J. No. 4345 (Ont. S.C.)

(b) Reasonableness or Unreasonableness of Each Party’s Behaviour

6

[21]

Taking into account the mother's success on the child support issue and her greatersuccess on the property issues than the father a fair and reasonable award for the timespent by her lawyer is $30,000.

Expenses Properly Paid or Payable

[22]

The mother claimed disbursements of $3,716.37 and the father claimed disbursements of
$1,632.48.
The mother's Bill included process server and courier fees totalling
$1,402.50: the father incurred charges of $1,325.59 for the same items. Neither partyprovided greater detail about these charges or any supporting invoices. In each case asolicitor's Affidavit of Disbursements would have been of great assistance since thecharges seem inexplicably high for a relatively uncomplicated case involving fewwitnesses, all of whom resided locally and the parties were represented by counsel.

[23]

In the absence of more detailed information only $2,000 in disbursements will beallowed.

Any Other Relevant Matter

[24]

Not applicable.

Costs Award

[25]

The father shall pay to the mother of costs of $32,000 inclusive of disbursements, plusHST.

Pre-judgment Interest

[26]

The jurisdiction to award Pre-Judgment interest (“PJI”) is conferred by sections 128 and130 of the Courts of Justice Act 7 (“CJA”),128. (1) A person who is entitled to an order for the payment ofmoney is entitled to claim and have included in the order an awardof interest thereon at the prejudgment interest rate, calculated fromthe date the cause of action arose to the date of the order.
130. (1) The court may, where it considers it just to do so, inrespect of the whole or any part of the amount on which interest ispayable under section 128 or 129,
(a) disallow interest under either section;

7

Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43

would be inappropriate and in fact undesirable. I have no intentionof going line-by-line through the applicant’s bill of costs…

7
(b) allow interest at a rate higher or lower than thatprovided in either section; and

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the court shall take intoaccount,
(a) changes in market interest rates;
(b) the circumstances of the case;
(c) the fact that an advance payment was made;
(d) the circumstances of medical disclosure by the plaintiff;
(e) the amount claimed and the amount recovered in theproceeding;
(f) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or tolengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding;and
(g) any other relevant consideration.

[27]

In Burgess v. Burgess8 , the court held that as a general rule PJI should be paid on anequalization payment unless exceptions applied, and also set out the circumstances to beconsidered when making such an award. While that case dealt with married spouses towhich the provisions of the Family Law Act 9 applied, there is nothing in section 128 ofthe Courts of Justice Act which prevents such an award being made in cases involvingunmarried domestic partners. The factors to consider include circumstances where,
(a) the payor spouse cannot monetize the asset giving rise to theequalization payment (in Burgess the asset was a party's futureentitlement to a pension);
(b) the payor had no use of the asset before trial;
(c) the asset generated no income; and
(d) the payor spouse had not delayed the case being brought totrial.

[28]

Burgess does not purport to restrict the circumstances in which an exception might apply.
Nor is the general rule restricted to issues involving property - retroactive support awards

Burgess v. Burgess, (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 547, [1995] O.J. No. 2242 (Ont. C.A.)
Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3

(c) allow interest for a period other than that provided ineither section.

may attract interest from the date that the support payment accrued: Debora v. Debora10 ,affirmed in Debora v. Debora11 . Section 130 (2) (f) also allows a court to award PJI
where a party has unreasonably lengthened the duration of the proceedings. Care must betaken, however, to avoid penalizing a party twice for unreasonable litigation conductwhen dealing with costs.

[29]

In this case the mother claims PJI of $3,293.39 most of which relates to the propertyaward. This calculation was based on the total value of that award calculated fromAugust 17, 2014, then adjusted to take into account the $60,000 paid to her pursuant tothe Order of Kaufman J. made April 8, 2015.

[30]

The father contends that no PJI should be awarded because he had to borrow funds toadvance the mother $60,000 in May 2015, the mother benefited from the properties’
appreciation after the parties separated and that he will need to further refinance hisresidence to pay anything further ordered.

[31]

Complicating this analysis is the fact that there is no evidence as to what the propertieswere worth when the parties finally separated in June 2014. They agreed at trial that thecombined property value as of late 2015 was $973,555.

[32]

It seems likely that there was some appreciation in value after the parties separated butthe father cannot raise as a shield to the mother’s claim his choice of retaining theproperties or having to refinance them to advance her funds or to pay the Judgment orany consequent costs award. The mother should not be penalized in subsidizing thefather’s decision to retain the family residence. He could have at any time taken steps totry to sell the properties: he also disobeyed the Order of Kaufman J. dated April 8, 2015
in mortgaging the vacant lot to enable him to pay the $60,000 to the mother for her titletransfer to him of their residence.

[33]

This court has broad, but principled, discretion to award an amount for PJI which itconsiders just. In my view, it would be fair and reasonable to award the mother $2,500
for PJI relating to the property and support issues.

Disposition

[34]

11

Accordingly, the father shall pay to the mother costs in the amount of $34,500
comprising fees ($30,000), disbursements ($2,000) and PJI ($2,500) plus HST. Of theamount awarded, the sum of $7,500 is related to support and shall therefore beenforceable as a support Order by the Family Responsibility Office.
A SupportDeduction Order shall issue for that amount.
