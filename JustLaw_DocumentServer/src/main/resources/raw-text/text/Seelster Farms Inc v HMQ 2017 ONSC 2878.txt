SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE – ONTARIO

ENDORSEMENT

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario (“HMQ”) seeks an order to

enforce the agreement between counsel to wait for the outcome of the motion thedefendants HMQ and Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (“OLG”) havebrought to quash summonses before examining any of the individuals who havebeen served under Rule 39.03; or

[2]

In the alternative, HMQ seeks an order to stay each summons served on

the following witnesses until the outcome of the motion to quash:
(i)

Karim Bardeesy

(ii)

Don Drummond

(iii)

Dwight Duncan

(iv)

Darcy McNeil

(v)

Rod Seiling

(vi)

Tim Shorthill

(vii) John Snobelen
(viii) Blair Stansky
(ix)

John Wilkinson

[1]

[3]

HMQ now acts for witnesses Mr. McGuinty, Mr. McMeekin, Mr. Orsini and

persons in abeyance until the motion to quash has been heard and determined.

[4]

The motion to quash has now been scheduled for hearing on June 19,

2017.
DECISION

[5]

The motion was granted on April 27, 2017 for reasons to follow. These are

those reasons.
REASONS

[6]

On March 7, 2017, Mr. Matthews, as counsel for the Plaintiffs, confirmed

the following arrangement by email to Ms. Machado at HMQ:
“In light of HMQ’s confirmation that it will move to quash the Summonses for thethirteen witnesses listed in your email, below, the Plaintiffs confirm that theexaminations of these witnesses will not go forward on the dates specified in therespect Summonses. Instead, the dates for these examinations will be fixedfollowing determination of the motion to quash by Justice Emery, assuming theplaintiffs prevail.”

[7]

In Dietrich-Collins Equipment Co. v. General Motors of Canada Ltd.

(1981), 31 O.R. (2d) 687 the court held that an agreement between counsel withrespect to the conduct of litigation ought to be enforced, provided that agreement

Premier Wynne. The parties have agreed to hold the examination of those

is clear, unambiguous and reasonable. The email from Mr. Matthews to Ms.

[8]

Rather than decide the motion of HMQ on the basis of any agreement

reached between Mr. Matthews and Ms. Machado on March 7, 2017, the betterbasis on which to decide the question is whether the summons should be stayedupon applying the test in RJR MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)

[1994] (S.C.R) 311.

I consider the correspondence from Mr. Matthews to Ms.

Machado on March 7, 2017 to be evidence of a larger picture.

[9]

On the evidence filed by HMQ as the moving party and by the plaintiffs in

response, I find there is a serious issue to be tried. That issue is whether thedefendants will have grounds to quash the several summonses served onparticular witnesses based on the relevance of their proposed evidence to theissues on the upcoming motion for summary judgment. The serious issue here isfurther augmented by the novel question of whether HMQ or OLG can seek anorder to quash the summons of any witness neither of them represents. I havebeen told that this is a standing issue on which there is no law to guide the courtin the context of a motion for summary judgment.

[10]

I take the letter from Mr. Matthews dated March 7, 2017 as evidence that

counsel for the plaintiffs viewed these questions as serious issues to be tried, atleast at that time. In my view, it was a courteous and correct position to take.

Machado meets this criterion.

[11]

Counsel for the Plaintiffs did not propose to schedule examinations under

motion to quash until April 12, 2017. In a letter that day, Mr. Matthews makesreference to my endorsement released on April 11, 2017. That endorsementdealt with the ability of the parties to proceed with examinations under the Rulesin the absence of any order to the contrary. In his letter dated April 12, 2017, Mr.Matthews states:
“As we have previously explained, our willingness to delay the rule 39.09
examinations of witnesses in the face of HMQ’s and OLG’s motions to quashwas premised on the understanding that HMQ had first spoken to thesewitnesses, ascertained that they had no possible relevant evidence, and receiveddirection from the witnesses to quash their summonses. It subsequently becameapparent to us that HMQ and OLG had unilaterally resolved to seek to quash thesummonses of witnesses who they do not represent without having done any ofthese things. This, in turn, caused the plaintiffs to re-evaluate their willingness todelay their rule 39.03 examinations. As noted above, and in light of thesedevelopments, we have now decided to proceed with our examinations asscheduled.”

[12]

It therefore appears that counsel for the plaintiffs “re-evaluated” their

willingness to delay Rule 39.03 examinations, citing a misunderstanding of thebasis for the agreement confirmed on March 7, 2017. HMQ argues that toreverse course on the agreement before the motion to quash is heard will causeirreparable harm to its position on that motion.

[13]

Both

parties

focused

on

Canada

(Attorney

General)

v.

Canada

(Information Commissioner) [2009] F.C.J. No. 1648, affirmed at 2001 FCA 26 onirreparable harm as a factor to consider. HMQ submitted in its factum (at

Rule 39.03 for nine of the thirteen witnesses that are the subject of HMQ’s

paragraph 35) that the Federal Court recognized that a party would suffer

was compelled, making the pending motion “moot or futile”.

[14]

The plaintiffs argue (in paragraph 194 of their factum) that the Federal

Court of Appeal overturned this decision on the issue of irreparable harm.

[15]

As I read the appeal decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada

(Information Commissioner), that part of the order under appeal that was setaside turned on the facts before the court. The Federal Court said this atparagraph 12 of the appeal decision:

[12]
First, the fact that irreparable harm may arguably arise does not establishirreparable harm. What the respondents had to prove, on a balance ofprobabilities, is that irreparable harm would result from compliance with thesubpoenas issued on behalf of the Commissioner (Manitoba (Attorney General)

[16]

The facts in evidence before this court are different. HMQ has filed

sufficient evidence that, when read in conjunction with the factual matrix theplaintiffs have put into evidence, there is a real prospect on the balance ofprobabilities that compliance with the summons could result in irreparable harmto the interests of HMQ in this litigation. The harm alleged by HMQ is not merelyspeculative or hypothetical. If the plaintiffs obtained evidence from witnessesunder summons before the motion to quash was decided on its merits, the

irreparable harm if compliance with a subpoena in advance of a motion to quash

motion to quash would become moot or futile. In Bisaillon c. R., 1999

of Appeal that:

[32]
According to RJR-MacDonald, supra, the concept of irreparable harmrefers more to the nature of the harm caused than to its extent and involveseither harm which cannot be quantified in monetary terms or harm for whichthere is no remedy. Beetz J. made similar comments in Metropolitan Stores,supra, when he said that irreparable harm is harm for which damages cannotcompensate, or can only compensate with difficulty.

[33]
In the case at bar I feel that the applicants would be likely to suffer suchharm if the stay were not granted. Their appeal from the order by the motionsjudge will become moot or futile if Revenue Canada obtains the materialrequested before the appeal is decided on its merits. The harm seems especiallyirreparable since refusal to grant the stay is likely to deprive the applicants of thebenefit of their right of appeal, which is itself concerned with obtaining a stay in aproceeding where the applicants" right to privacy is at issue as well as the legalityand constitutionality of the exercise of a ministerial power. The applicants" appealwould become moot or futile from execution of the very order from which they areappealing. In this connection Stone J. wrote for this Court in New BrunswickElectric Power Commission and Maritime Electric Company Limited v. TheNational Energy Board :11
These observations bring into focus the absurdity that could result if, pendingan appeal, operation of the order appealed from rendered it nugatory. Ourappellate mandate would then become futile and be reduced to mere wordslacking in practical substance. The right of a party to an "appeal" would exist onlyon paper for, in reality, there would be no "appeal" to be heard, or to be won orlost. The appeal process would be stifled. It would not, as it should, hold out thepossibility of redress to a party invoking it.

[17]

It seems to me that the circumstances in this case are closer to those in

Bisaillon than they are to those in the Canada (Attorney General) case. Theappellate decision in Bisaillon is therefore more persuasive to stay the summonspending the motion to quash. The motion to quash, like the appeal in Bisaillon, is

CarswellNet 2578 Justice Letourneau J.A. wrote on behalf of the Federal Court

the process in which the rights of the parties to obtain information shall be

[18]

In a passage found in paragraph 59 of RJR MacDonald Inc. v. Canada,

Justice Lebel describes “irreparable” as the nature of the harm rather than itsmagnitude. It is harm which cannot be quantified in monetary terms, or thatcannot otherwise be cured.

[19]

The RJR MacDonald case is not only persuasive, it is binding on this court.

I therefore adopt and apply the description of irreparable harm provided by theSupreme Court to the prospect and nature of the harm to which HMQ is exposedif these examinations are not stayed.

[20]

It is the party seeking the examination who bears the evidentiary burden to

satisfy the court that an individual has information relevant to an issue on thepending motion, and that the individual is in a position to provide such evidence:
Ontario Psychological Assn. v. Mardonet, 2015 ONSC 3063. The time to addressthat burden will come when the motion to quash is heard on June 19, 2017.

[21]

The technical nature of the irreparable harm that would be caused if the

examinations under Rule 39.03 are not stayed raises the balance of convenienceinto stark relief. The motion of HMQ at its essence seeks temporary relief for 7
weeks to stay examinations on dates for which summonses have been served.

determined on a proper evidentiary record.

Those dates were selected arbitrarily and there is no evidence the plaintiffs will

[22]

The Plaintiffs’ argument that one or more of the proposed individuals they

wish to examine between May 1 and 15, 2017 were not contacted by HMQ todetermine if they have relevant evidence to give on the pending motions forsummary judgment, or to receive directions to seek an order quashing his or hersummons has no merit at this time.

[23]

The balance of convenience favours HMQ under these circumstances.

CONCLUSION/ORDER

[24]

The motion materials of HMQ have satisfied the test to order a stay set out

in RJR MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General). In my view, the motion toquash raises issues of standing in a summary judgment context, as well asissues on the substantive grounds for the motion under Rule 39.03. To me, theseare serious questions. I consider the prospect of usurping the purpose of themotion to quash if the examinations under Rule 39.03 were allowed to proceed tobe irreparable harm to the legal interests of HMQ. Once the evidence is given, itis evidence to be considered one way or another. In the result, I consider thebalance of convenience favours HMQ.

be prejudiced by the delay.

[25]

For these reasons, the motion of HMQ was granted. The summonses at

COSTS

Costs of this motion are reserved to the motion on June 19, 2017.
