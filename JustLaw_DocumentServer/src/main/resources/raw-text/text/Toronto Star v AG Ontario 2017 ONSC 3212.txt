ENDORSEMENT

[1]

Counsel met with me today for a preliminary case management conference.

[2]

The following timetable has been agreed upon by both parties:
Respondent (“MAG”) Responding Motion Record – September 29, 2017
Applicant (“Star”) Reply Motion Record – November 16, 2017
Cross-examinations on affidavits – by December 15, 2017
Star Factum – January 15, 2018
MAG Factum – February 19, 2018
Hearing – March 8-9, 2018

Paragraph 1(a) of the Notice of Application seeks an order in respect of “quasi-judicialtribunals, including those listed in Schedule ‘A’ to this Notice of Application, through theirinclusion in the Schedule of Regulation 460, R.R.O. 990 to FIPPA…” [emphasis added]. Thereare 16 specific tribunals listed in Schedule ‘A’, but the language of para 1(a) suggests that anysimilarly situated tribunal included in the relevant regulation could be subject to thisconstitutional challenge. Counsel for MAG advises that there are potentially several hundredsuch tribunals, which would make this litigation unwieldy.

Counsel for the Star and counsel for MAG have therefore agreed that the subject matterof the Application will be limited to the 16 tribunals named in Schedule ‘A’ to the Notice ofApplication. Whether an eventual ruling in this Application is applicable to any other tribunal inOntario will be left to be determined at another time, if and when the specific question arises.
