CORRIGENDUM TO REASONS FOR DECISION

[1]
Ms. Pirkova has brought to my attention an arithmetical error in my decisiondated April 18, 2017. She quite rightly points out that the calculation for 2015 inparagraph 66 of the decision is incorrect. Eight months of child support at $898 permonth comes to $7,184, not $4,490 as stated in the paragraph. Thus, Mr. Popovski willowe an additional $2,694.

CITATION: Popovski v. Pirkova, 2017 ONSC 3355
COURT FILE NO.: FS-15-403750
DATE: 20170530

-2As a result of this error, the following changes must be made to the decision:
a)

Paragraph 66 of the decision must be amended so that the calculation for2015 now reads:
“2015

8 months @ 898 $7,184”

b)

Paragraph 66 of the decision must be amended so that the TOTAL is now
$59,339;

c)

Paragraph 68 of the decision must be amended so that the set-off amountis now $45,588;

d)

Paragraph 77 of the decision must be amended so that the total set-offamount for retroactive child support is now $41,388; and

e)

Paragraph 126(a) of the decision must be amended so that the figure isnow $41,388.

[3]
I recognize that Mr. Popovski suggests Ms. Pirkova should have appealed thedecision to address this issue. He is incorrect. Rule 59.06(1) of the Rules of CivilProcedure permits the amendment of an order containing an error as a result of a slipor omission. Here, as I understand it, the formal order has not yet been taken out. I
retain the jurisdiction to correct the arithmetical mistake in the decision. No formalmotion was necessary. Dealing with the issue by way of correspondence, bringing theerror to my attention, was the most efficient and cost-effective way of addressing themistake.

[4]
An order shall issue making these corrections to the decision.
respects, the decision is confirmed.

In all other
