CITATION: Craven v. Osidacz and Osidacz; and Craven v. Osidacz, 2017 ONSC 1757
COURT FILE NO.: CV-06-251 (Brantford); and CV-08-846 (Brantford)
DATE: 2017-05-19

[1]

These are two proceedings before this Court which stem from a series of

Julie Craven and their son, Jared Osidacz, and also stemming from theadministration of the Estate of Andrew Peter Osidacz.

[2]

On November 18, 2010, I ordered the two proceedings to be consolidated.

[3]

The first proceeding is the claim by Julie Craven, in which she claims the

following damages from the Estate of Andrew Peter Osidacz (the “estate”):
 Family Law Act damages for the wrongful death of Jared Osidacz in the sumof $125,000.00 plus interest in the amount of $43,753.60;
 General damages for the 2002 assault of Andrew Peter Osidacz on JulieCraven in the sum of $25,000.00 plus interest in the amount of $8,372.42;
 General damages for the 2006 assault and attempted murder of Julie Cravenby Andrew Peter Osidacz in the sum of $90,000.00 plus interest in theamount of $31,439.76;
 Aggravated/punitive damages in the sum of $75,000.00 plus interest in theamount of $26,252.16;

acts perpetrated by the deceased Andrew Osidacz against the plaintiff/applicant,

-3-

 Dependant’s relief under Part V of the Succession Law Reform Act in the

 Spousal support arrears in the sum of $22,110.00 plus interest in the amountof $7,214.02; and
 OHIP subrogated expenses in the sum of $457.85.

[4]

The total sum of damages claimed by Julie Craven in the wrongful

death/assaults action is $622,159.41. This sum as acknowledged by both plaintiffand the defendants far exceeds the total value that the Estate was ever worth.

[5]

The second proceeding, bearing Court File No. CV-08-846 (the “estate

action”) relates to claims by Julie Craven that Michael Osidacz violated his dutiesas executor and estate trustee of the Estate. On that basis, Julie Craven claims thatMichael should be held personally responsible for all legal costs expended by theEstate in defending the actions. Further, Julie Craven seeks her own legal costs tobe paid by Michael personally on a substantial indemnity basis.

[6]

There are ultimately two issues that the plaintiff has asked this Court to

determine:

sum of $156,520.00;

-4-

1. What is the quantum of damages that the plaintiff/applicant has suffered

assault and attempted murder?
2. Has Michael violated his duties and acted unreasonably as an estate trustee?
If so, to what extent is he personally liable to repay the Estate for the legalcosts expended out of the Estate and for the legal costs of theplaintiff/applicant?

[7]

Liability against Michael Osidacz acting as estate trustee of the Estate of

Andrew Peter Osidacz was established by way of summary judgment of theHonourable Mr. Justice Arrell on January 21, 2009. The claim against ElizabethOsidacz has been withdrawn.

[8]

Michael denies that he acted outside of his duties or was unreasonable in his

role as estate trustee and denies that he should be held personally liable to repaythe legal fees expended to defend the Estate or that he should be personally liablefor all legal costs of Julie Craven.

[9]

The following facts are not in dispute and have been admitted by the

defendant:

from her 2002 assault, the 2006 wrongful death of Jared, and her 2006

-5-

 On April 23, 2002, the deceased, Andrew Osidacz (“Andrew”), physically

Brantford, Ontario (“18 Cecil”) (the “2002 assault”).
 Subsequently, family law proceedings ensued between Andrew and Julieand ultimately, on May 21, 2002, Justice Cavarzan awarded Julie interimcustody of their son Jared Osidacz (“Jared”) with weekend access forAndrew, exclusive possession of 18 Cecil, the matrimonial home, monthlychild support in the sum of $500.00, monthly spousal support in the sum of
$670.00, and ordered that Andrew and Julie were restrained from molesting,harassing, or annoying each other.
 Andrew pleaded guilty to assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wasgiven a suspended sentence and placed on probation for two years.

[10]

On March 8, 2006, Andrew Osidacz, the estranged spouse of Julie Craven,

while exercising his right of access to Jared Osidacz, the child of the marriage,stabbed eight year-old Jared to death. Andrew Osidacz also stabbed two otherpeople, his then girlfriend and her daughter, both of whom survived.

[11]

Later that night, Andrew Osidacz forced his way into the home of Julie

Craven (the former matrimonial home), advised her that he had killed Jared and

assaulted Julie at their matrimonial home located at 18 Cecil Avenue,

-6-

terrorized her at knifepoint for some 45 minutes culminating in his being shot to

Craven.

[12]

While at Craven’s residence, Andrew telephoned his mother, Elizabeth

Osidacz. She lived two doors down and eventually arrived at Julie Craven’s home,18 Cecil Avenue, Brantford, with two grandchildren.

[13]

Despite pleas for help from Julie, Mrs. Osidacz did nothing while in the

residence to assist Julie Craven or Jared. She told Julie that she (Julie) had “pushedhim too far”, in reference to Andrew and the unfolding tragedy.

[14]

Elizabeth Osidacz locked the door to 18 Cecil Avenue upon her arrival.

[15]

Officers of the Brantford Police Service arrived at the 18 Cecil Avenue

residence and were let in by one of Elizabeth’s grandchildren. The policeconfronted Andrew Osidacz in the bathroom of the home where he had forciblydragged Julie Craven. He refused to drop the knife which he was holding and justas he was about to plunge the knife into Julie’s throat, and he was shot to death bypolice thus saving Julie’s life.

[16]

The effects of the tragic events linger on. Ms. Craven’s counsel argues that

the situation was exacerbated by the litigation “strategy” employed by the Estate

death by officers of the Brantford Police Service in order to save the life of Julie

-7-

trustee of Andrew Osidacz’s estate, Michael Osidacz, the brother of Andrew,

claims for compensation.

[17]

The Last Will and Testament of Andrew Osidacz, dated July 13, 2002,

provided nothing for Julie Craven or Jared. The will appointed Michael Osidacz asestate trustee with the residue of the Estate divided equally between Michael andElizabeth Osidacz, Andrew’s mother. This created an inherent conflict of interestin Michael’s role as estate trustee. The will stated very little in terms of how anylitigation would be handled, except for paragraph 9(h) which directed the trustee to
“release, forgive, compromise, settle or waive any claim or debt which is owing tome or by me at the time of my death”. Despite that directive, the Estate fought
“tooth and nail” virtually every claim advanced by Julie Craven.

[18]

Andrew’s estate was primarily comprised of the following assets:

i.

Two RBC bank accounts;

ii.

A Manulife insurance policy;

iii.

A pension; and

iv.

Real property located at 18 Cecil.

which involved advancing virtually every legal defence available to resist Julie’s

-8-

The total value of the assets of the Estate amounted to $408,912.76.

[19]

Although liability was established in 2009, the respondents did not

concede that Julie Craven’s damages exceeded the value of the assets of the Estateor agree to any specific amount.

[20]

The position of the Estate of Andrew Osidacz was that Julie Craven

suffered no damages or that the damages she suffered were caused by “pre-existinginjuries”. Therefore, damages had to be assessed at trial.

[21]
i.

Julie Craven seeks damages as follows:
Family Law Act damagesHomicide of Jared Osidacz - $125,000.00
$125,000.00 x 3.3% interest = $4,125.00 to October 24, 2016.

ii.

General damagesRe assault April 23, 2002 - $25,000.00
Prejudgment interest to October 24, 2016 at 2.3% = $8,372.42

Approximately $130,000.00 was available in the Estate at the time of trial.

-9-

iii.

General damages for assault, forcible confinement, trespass, attempted

Prejudgment interest to October 24, 2016 - $2,970.00
iv.

Succession Law Reform Act “Dependant’s Relief” damages and/or incomeclaim - $156,520.00

v.

OHIP subrogated expense - $11,457.85

vi.

The plaintiff also claims aggravated damages in the amount of $75,000.00
and punitive damages in the amount of $50,000.00

vii.

There is also a claim for arrears of spousal support (s. 34(4) of the FamilyLaw Act) – 33 months x $1,200.00 = $39,600.00 plus interest to October 24,2016 at $12,386.36

[22]

Based on the above, Julie Craven’s claim for damages amounts to

$622,159.41, not including costs and some interest to March 1, 2017.

[23]

Some, but not all damages were admitted by the defendant estate trustee,

Michael Osidacz, on October 20, 2016, as follows:
i.

That Julie Craven sustained “substantial damages” as a result of theincidents of April 23, 2002, and March 18, 2006.

murder (March 18, 2006) - $90,000.00

- 10 -

ii.

That Julie Craven suffered damages of at least $25,000.00 for the April 23,

iii.

That Julie Craven suffered damages of $100,000.00 for the wrongful deathof Jared Osidacz.

iv.

That Julie Craven suffered damages of at least $50,000.00 for assault with aweapon and forcible confinement.
Total damages admitted: $175,000.00 not including interest or costs

[24]

With prejudgment interest, the above amounts (without costs) total

$237,826.64 broken down as follows as of March 1, 2017:
i.

Damages of at least $25,000.00 for the April 23, 2002 assault against

her, from April 23, 2002, to March 1, 2017:
$25,000.00 x 2.3% / 365 = $1.58 per day x 5,426 daysii.

= $8,573.08

Damages of $100,000.00 for the wrongful death of Jared Osidacz,

from March 18, 2006 to March 1, 2017:
$100,000.00 x 3.3% / 365 = $9.04 per day x 4,001 days = $36,169.04

2002 assault against her.

- 11 -

iii.

Damages of at least $50,000.00 for assault with a weapon and forcible

$50,000.00 x 3.3% / 365 = $4.52 per day x 4,001 days

= $18,084.52

Total admitted damages

= $175,000.00

Total prejudgment interest

= $62,826.64

Total admitted damages and interest

= $237,826.64

This sum clearly exceeds the amount in the Estate as of October 2006 whichwas approximately $130,000.00.

[25]

Ms. Craven also seeks an order that Michael Osidacz repay to the Estate

the sum of $91,277.98 which has been paid out of the Estate in legal costs.

[26]

There is also a claim under the Succession Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990

and an order continuing $1,000.00 per month for spousal support.

Claim under S. 34(4) of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990

[27]

Counsel for the applicant claims that the order of May 21, 2002 for spousal

support was binding on the Estate.

- 12 -

[28]

At the time of his death on March 18, 2006, Andrew Osidacz was still

May 21, 2002. This support was otherwise needed by Julie Craven for her supportand that of her son Jared.

[29]

In accordance with the said order at paragraph 2, the sum of $500.00 per

month was payable for child support and in accordance with paragraph 3, the sumof $670.00 (net) per month was payable for spousal support.

[30]

However, immediately after Jared and Andrew’s death, the Estate stopped

paying spousal support. The parties have agreed that the arrears under the formersupport order of May 21, 2002 totals $22,110.00 plus prejudgment interest.

Damages for Wrongful Death

[31]

Damages for the wrongful death of Jared are at the core of this litigation

but are certainly not the only head of damages sought. A claim for wrongful deathis by its nature a claim under Part V of the Family Law Act for “loss of guidance,care and companionship”.

subject to a spousal and child support order rendered by Mr. Justice Cavarzan on

[32]

That Jared Osidacz and his mother Julie shared a close personal bond was

Eva Palanio clearly testified to this, as well as the horrible suffering to Julie as aresult of the loss of this relationship.

[33]

Happy and playful photographs of Jared, both individually and with his

mother, Julie Craven, were filed in the exhibit book filed. It is obvious from thesephotographs, the various cards and artwork in the exhibit book, that the death ofJared at the hands of his father as opposed to dying in a car accident would causeenormous suffering for the plaintiff and her wellbeing – a fact demonstrated by theevidence at trial.

[34]

As stated above, liability of Andrew Osidacz for the murder of Jared has

been established.

[35]

In To et al. v. Toronto Board of Education et al. [2001] O.J. No. 3490

(C.A.), the jury assessed damages for the tragic accidental death of a child at
$100,000.00 payable to each of the deceased’s parents. The Ontario Court ofAppeal upheld the damage award payable to the parents and since that time thedecision has served as a benchmark for assessing damages for wrongful death inmany cases. I find that the kind of strong bond between Jared and Julie asdemonstrated at trial through the applicant and multiple corroborating witnesses

not disputed at the trial in any way. Julie Craven, John Craven, Louise Huzul, and

- 14 -

would see damages awarded to Julie Craven in at least the amount of $100,000.00

every being, her “soul mate” so to speak, and the light of her life. In Fiddler v.
Chiavetti, 2010 ONCA, the Court of Appeal applied the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) to establish that $100,000.00 wrongful death in 2005 (as opposed to 1992
when the facts of To et al. v. Toronto Board of Education et al. occurred) wasroughly $125,000.00, at the upper end of the range.

[36]

The present case involved the death of a defenceless eight year-old child

by multiple fatal stab wounds. Jared had suffered multiple defensive wounds to hishands as indicated in the medical reports filed and as was confirmed by JulieCraven in her evidence in-chief. I find that the award for loss of care andcompanionship based on the case law and on the evidence, establishes that theapplicant Julie Craven is entitled to damages in the amount of $125,000.00 withrespect to the wrongful death of Jared Osidacz.

Damages to Julie Craven Arising from Assault, Forcible Confinement,Trespass, and Attempted Murder on March 18, 2006

for wrongful death of Jared. It is clear that Jared was part of the core of Julie’s

- 15 -

[37]

Having murdered his son Jared, Andrew Osidacz attended at the residence

with a knife, began assaultive behaviour toward her. She described him as coveredin blood and in effect dragging her around the various rooms in the house with aknife in his hand, and at one point had a knife to her throat. This ordeal went on forabout 45 minutes with Julie asking where her son was and wanting to call 911 anddispatch them to where she thought he was.

[38]

At one point, it appeared as though he had raised the knife and was going

to put it down into her chest. This was when the police shot and killed Andrew.

[39]

Having been told that he had killed Jared and seeing him covered in blood

holding a knife and in effect chasing her around the house, and holding the knife toher throat saying “I’m going to kill her”, there is no doubt in my mind that this wasa horrifically terrifying experience and that Julie Craven truly feared for her life.
Prior to the beginning of trial, the defence conceded that with respect to the assault,Julie Craven suffered damages to the value of at least $50,000.00. Plaintiff’scounsel is seeking $90,000.00 under this set of damages. I find that this is areasonable sum of compensation for Julie Craven for all she went through duringthe attack in her home by her estranged husband, and her damages with respect tothe assault, attempted murder, and home invasion are set at $90,000.00.

of his estranged wife Julie Craven, told her that he had killed their son and armed

- 16 -

[40]

Applicant’s counsel argues that an award for aggravated damages is in

order in the circumstances of this case.

[41]

One of the leading cases in regard to aggravated and punitive damages is

the decision in Wieslawa Soczek v. Jan Soczek et al., 2016 ONSC 3701, anattempted murder case. In Soczek, the husband set his spouse on fire and stabbedher as she escaped from the residence. She suffered major burns and lifelonginjuries. The principles relating to the award of aggravated damages are set out inthat case as follows: “Aggravated damages may be awarded where a battery hasoccurred in humiliating or undignified circumstances. These damages serve to takeinto account any aggravating features of the case and to that extent increase theamount awarded for general damages”.

[42]

I find that the attempted murder of the plaintiff was particularly

humiliating and horrific and gives rise to aggravating circumstances in the sensethat Andrew told his wife that he had murdered her son and yet did not allow her tomake any calls for help, and when asked what his last words were, she was told byAndrew that her son’s last words were “Daddy, please don’t kill me”.

The

Aggravated Damages

- 17 -

damages are also aggravated by his confining her to her house when she was

enter, hostage-taking style conduct which went on for about 45 minutes,cumulating in a dramatic attempted murder of Julie Craven. As in Soczek, thetorture committed by Julie’s spouse, albeit estranged, with the terrorizingknowledge that she could not help her son, Jared, was especially traumatizing,humiliating and undignified.

[43]

I find that an award of aggravated damages in the amount of $75,000.00 is

appropriate in these circumstances.

Punitive Damages

[44]

Applicant’s counsel seeks an award of punitive damages in the amount of

$75,000.00.

[45]

In Soczek, above, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that the

objectives of punitive damages go beyond punishment and deterrence. They alsoinclude denunciation being the means by which the trier of fact expresses hisoutrage at the aggregious conduct of the defendant. In its decision in the case of de

pleading to go and help Jared. This was a terrorizing knifepoint attack, break and

- 18 -

Montigny v. Brossard (Succession), [2010] 3 SCR 64, 2010 SCC 51, at page 54,

...care must be taken not to give exemplary damages a subsidiarycriminal justice role. The fact that Martin Brossard cannot bepunished for his actions by the criminal justice system is not adetermining factor in the analysis.... It is a requirement for punitivedamages not only that the defendant commit a tort advertently, butthat the conduct be exceptional.... The claim may be brought only bythe victim of the tort and damages may be awarded only in referenceto the conduct that affected the victim.

[46]

In respect of the present case, the conduct of the perpetrator clearly reaches

the status of being “exceptional” as referred to above. The circumstances of thepresent case, whereby Julie Craven was terrorized at knifepoint for 45 minutes andcame within seconds of being brutally stabbed to death, justify an award of
$50,000.00 in punitive damages against the Estate.

[47]

As to the difference between punitive damages and aggravated damages,

the Court of Appeal in Plester v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, 2006Punitive damages, as the name would indicate, are designed to punish.
In this, they constitute an exception to the general common law rule thatdamages are designed to compensate the injured, not to punish thewrongdoer. Aggravated damages will frequently cover conduct which

the Supreme Court of Canada stated as follows:

Julie Craven – Loss of Income

[48]

It is the plaintiff’s position that the events of April 2002 and March 18,

2006 caused severe psychological damage to Julie Craven and disabled her fromworking for the period March 18, 2006 to the present. Although the respondentsacknowledge that Julie Craven suffered from PTSD and had a major depressivedisorder as a result of the March 18, 2006 episode, Michael Osidacz does notadmit that the effects of the same disabled her from working from March 18, 2006
onward.

[49]

Julie Craven’s evidence on her medical issues and disability was

uncontradicted at trial. In-chief, she testified that she would need, “time-outs allthe time”, that she cannot stand “certain noises” such as a clock; that she has to runout of a room on occasion; that, “she can’t breathe”; that her heart is frequentlylike a “tornado”; that her teeth are “clenched”; and that she “panics” in groups ofpeople – all to the present day. In regard to attempting similar remunerativeemployment as she previously enjoyed, Julie commented on her former work atTranquility Place, the retirement home in Brantford. She said it involved a

preparation of food with “large knives” which she could not have done, and would

completed training as an educational assistant by March 2006. She commentedthat she was afraid of children “running up to her”. She could not stand the soundsof children “shrieking and screaming”.

[50]

Julie Craven’s psychiatrist, Dr. Theresa Clarke, was called as a witness.

She outlined the debilitating effects the incidents had on Julie and her family life,her relationships, her relationship with her son, and her ability to work. Thisincludes anxiety, panic attacks (with disassociation), shortness of breath, feelingnumb and distant caused by ordinary events – seeing bathtubs, knives, etc. Afterdiagnosing PTSD and major depressive disorder (and confirming that she stillsuffered from same for the period of 2006 to present), Dr. Clarke outlined that 30
percent of PTSD victims essentially have permanent aftereffects that are “chronic,pernicious and impairing”.

[51]

Julie Craven was not cross-examined by counsel on the issue of her fitness

and ability to work and the direct medical evidence of Dr. Clarke was completelyunchallenged at trial, including Julie’s inability to work from March 18, 2006 up toand including the present time and into the foreseeable future.

need “timeouts” and the need to “run out of the building”. Julie had nearly

- 21 -

[52]

That Julie Craven could not “work” is also confirmed by her financial

evidence to dispute the income loss by Julie Craven for the period 2006 to 2016.

[53]

Based on the foregoing, including the tax returns submitted by Julie

Craven, it was clear from the evidence that Julie was disabled from working fromMarch 18, 2006 to the present.

[54]

Plaintiff’s counsel calculates Julie Craven’s claim for lost income to the

end of 2016 discounted by 20% to be $156,520.00 based on her working 20 hoursper week, 12 months per year at $17.50 per hour ($350.00 per month) plus
$11,700.00 part-time earnings from Tranquility Place ($13.00 per hour x 30
months).

Succession Law Reform Act – Dependant’s Relief

[55]

As stated above, Mr. Justice Arrell already ordered interim dependant’s

relief on January 21, 2009 in favour of Julie Craven in the amount of $1,000.00 permonth under s. 64 of the Succession Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990. At that time,any issues respecting the six month limitation period (which is flexible) were dealtwith as they were raised by estate counsel. The limitation defence was thoroughly

information and tax returns. As with the medical evidence, the defence had no

- 22 -

rejected by Justice Arrell. S. 58 of the Succession Law Reform Act reads as

Order for support58. (1) Where a deceased, whether testate or intestate, has not madeadequate provision for the proper support of his dependants or any ofthem, the court, on application, may order that such provision as itconsiders adequate be made out of the estate of the deceased for theproper support of the dependants or any of them.

[56]

“Dependant” is defined in that act as including the spouse of the deceased

to whom the deceased was providing support or was under a legal obligation toprovide support immediately before his or her death.

[57]

Julie Craven clearly falls within the purview of this section of the Act as

the will of Andrew Osidacz did not provide for her and she was clearly dependenton Andrew Osidacz for support. This obligation would have immediatelytransferred to the Estate trustee who bitterly resisted even Julie’s modest claim of
$1,000.00 per month for interim dependant’s relief granted by Justice Arrell onJanuary 21, 2009.

[58]

An argument can be made that Julie’s potential claims for permanent relief

under Part V of the Succession Law Reform Act could engulf the entire estate ormost of it – even without consideration of the wrongful death of Jared. This is due

follows:

- 23 -

to her dependency on the Estate and her proven inability to work and earn an

[59]

What I must consider is what would be an appropriate amount of

Succession Law Reform Act dependant’s relief considering all the facts andcircumstances of the case and considering that $93,000.00 in interim dependant’srelief has already been paid as ordered by Justice Arrell.

[60]

I am satisfied on the evidence that the lingering aftereffects of the events of

March 18, 2006, including the attempted murder of Julie Craven, have scarred herfor life and there is no evidence she will be working in the foreseeable future.

[61]

SC) emphasis was placed on the term “proper” support in s. 58 of the SLRA and themoral obligations of a testator to provide for his dependants:
It is the duty of the Court, so far as is possible, to place itself in allrespects in the position of the testator, and to consider whether or not,having regard to all existing facts and surrounding circumstances, thetestator has been guilty of a manifest breach of that moral duty whicha just, but not a loving, husband or father owes his wife or towards hischildren, as the case may be.

[62]

In the present case, the sum of $156,520.00 is sought in relation to the “lost

income to date” of Julie Craven. This claim is not framed as SLRA dependant’srelief. However, under the circumstances, in my view what would be the

income.

- 24 -

appropriate amount of SLRA dependant’s relief is, in considering all the facts and

relief already paid as ordered by Justice Arrell, would have to take intoconsideration the loss of income claim in the amount of $156,520.00 plus interestas being duplicative. That amount however, as set out above, is loss of income todate. In my view, the situation is best dealt with through an award under the SLRA
as permanent relief in the amount of $200,000.00 in addition to the $93,000.00 ininterim relief already paid, given Julie’s age (i.e. mid-40s at the time of the loss)
and the fact she could be expected to live another 40 years from the date of thetragedies.
Depleting Assets of the Estate

[63]

Michael denies that he acted outside of his duties and was unreasonable in

his role as estate trustee, and denies that he should be held personally liable torepay the legal fees expended to defend the Estate. Further, he denies that heshould be personally liable for all legal costs of Julie Craven.

[64]

From the total value of the assets of the Estate of $408,912.76 as

mentioned above, the Estate has made the following expenditures:

1. Property payments: as of April 1, 2006, the Estate paid for several expenses

utilities (as of October 15, 2010), and general maintenance. Between April 1,2006 and the time Cecil was sold in August 2011, the total sum expended bythe Estate amounts to $66,577.60.
2. Dependant’s relief payments: on January 21, 2009, Justice Arrell ordered theEstate to pay Julie support under the Succession Law Reform Act in theamount of $1,000.00 per month. Since January 21, 2009, the Estate has paidJulie over $93,000.00 in dependant’s relief.
3. Estate solicitor fees: John Wiacek of the firm of Trepanier Verity LLP wasretained as the Estate solicitor to manage administration of the Estate and itsaccounting. In total, the Estate has paid Mr. Wiacek $8,871.32. There areadditional monies owing to Mr. Wiacek.
4. Estate litigation fees: Deborah Ditchfield of Waterous Holden AmeyHitchon LLP was retained by Andrew in and around April 2002 with respectto family law matters between himself and Julie Craven. Upon Andrew’sdeath, Ms. Ditchfield continued to act for the Estate.

In regards to the wrongful death/assaults action, the total amount of legal

additional $80,000.00 left owing. The defendant negotiated a reduction to
$20,000.00 of these outstanding monies which has now been paid out of theEstate for a total payout of $91,000.00 in legal fees.
5. Funeral expenses: a total of $11,941.57 was spent on funeral and cemeteryexpenses.
6. Income tax: a total of $4,964.46 was expended from the Estate account topay T1 income tax and T3 income tax.
As a result of the foregoing expenditures, the Estate had a value of
$132,530.82 at the commencement of trial, minus the $20,000.00 payable toMs. Ditchfield and additional monthly payments to Julie Craven, leaving acurrent value of approximately $107,530.82.

The total sum of damages claimed by Julie Craven in the wrongful

Estate was ever worth. This conclusion is based upon the assumption that MichaelOsidacz would not be required to repay $71,000.00+ in legal fees to the Estate or asignificant portion thereof plus interest. The plaintiff argues that if a significantrepayment of the costs paid to Waterous Holden is ordered in this action, it couldbring the “value” of the Estate to more than $200,000.00. They argue that justbecause there are no longer funds in the Estate or there are insufficient funds in theEstate, that does not deny the necessity to quantify damages or end the inquiry intothe Estate trustee’s conduct and deny various damage heads. They point out that s.
50 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, mandates that a trustee pay the debts of thedeceased on a proportionate basis if they exceed the value of the estate. This doesnot appear to have been done. Therefore, knowing the quantum of the indebtedness
(in this case the damages) is necessary in that there may be other monies that couldbe reclaimed or claimed from the trustee as having been improperly paid out. Justas importantly, however, a trial on the issue of damages was ordered by Mr. JusticeArrell on January 21, 2009. An assessment of the damages I find was necessarybefore liability had been established with respect to issues such as to claim fordamages as a result of Julie Craven being disabled from working from March 18,2006 to the present; the defendant did not admit punitive or aggravating damages;

An estate is not a juridical person and therefore parties cannot sue an

estate, but rather the estate through the estate trustee. As such, the estate trusteewill undoubtedly incur expenses and costs in the course of litigation.

[68]

The general principle that estate trustees are indemnified for all costs

including legal fees that are reasonably incurred is codified in s. 23.1 of the TrusteeAct which reads as follows:
23.1 (1) A trustee who is of the opinion that an expense would beproperly incurred in carrying out the trust may,
(a) pay the expense directly from the trust property; or
(b) pay the expense personally and recover a correspondingamount from the trust property.

(2) The Superior Court of Justice may afterwards disallow thepayment or recovery if it is of the opinion that the expense was notproperly incurred in carrying out the trust.

From this, I conclude that the executor is entitled, indeed, obliged to

reasonably.

[70]

Where the reasonableness of expenses incurred by the trustee is in

question, the estate trustee must show that they acted in good faith and had goodreason to believe the expenditures were necessary for the benefit of the estate at thetime the expense was incurred, and further, has the onus of proving that defendinga proceeding is reasonable.

Geffen v. Goodman is the leading case on the role of an estate trustee in

covering expenses of the estate, both during administration of the estate and withrespect to litigation involving the estate. The court stated:
The courts have long held that trustees are entitled to be indemnifiedfor all costs, including legal costs, which they have reasonablyincurred. Reasonable expenses include the costs of an actionreasonably defended: see Re Dingman (1915), 35 O.L.R. 51. In ReDallaway, [1982] 3 All E.R. 118, Sir Robert Megarry V.C. stated therule thus at p. 122:
In so far as such person [trustee] does not recover his costs fromany other person, he is entitled to take his costs out of the fundheld by him unless the court otherwise orders; and the court canotherwise order only on the ground that he has acted

unreasonably, or in substance for his own benefit, rather than forthe benefit of the fund.

[72]

It is the plaintiff’s position that Michael Osidacz should be personally

liable for repayment of the $91,277.98 (plus interest) in legal costs paid toWaterous Holden LLP without a court order.

[73]

The courts have held that a trustee may risk the expense of litigation as part

of discharging his duties to “collect the assets”. However, if there is some questionas to whether the proceedings are “meritorious” and whether it is “prudent orappropriate” for a trustee to pursue them, “the appropriate course of action is forthe trustee to apply to the court for its directions”.(ON SC) at p. 12

[74]

In the present case, the Estate trustee never sought directions from the

Court concerning whether or not the defences and claims it was advancing were
“meritorious” and whether or not it was “prudent or appropriate” to proceed; thatis, embarking on a vigorous “tooth and nail” defence or denying significant claimswithout evidence (even after liability was established).

[75]

There is considerable evidence, given Michael Osidacz’s interactions with

the plaintiff and her family, of significant personal animosity – dare I say hate –

between Michael Osidacz and Julie Craven and her family. Such animosity, it

[76]

As indicated in Bank of Nova Scotia Trust et al. v. Pressman et al., supra,

direction should have been immediately sought from the court as to whether or notthe intended path of the estate trustee was “prudent or appropriate”, especiallywhere, as here, the vigorous defence of the litigation was not specified in the will,an aggressive approach to same could (and did) lead to significant expense andcircumstances where the estate trustee was both personally and emotionallyinvolved.

[78]

The will stated very little in terms of how any litigation would be handled,

[79]

I find that mounting an “all-out” defence to the claims of Julie Craven in a

situation where liability was clear virtually from the start and where it should havebeen clear to any reasonable person that Julie Craven was entitled to substantialdamages which would likely exceed the assets of the Estate, and using the assets ofthe Estate to advance speculative and groundless defences, was anything butreasonable or “prudent or appropriate”.

[80]

To incur approximately $160,000.00 in legal fees defending an action that

was clearly likely to succeed with virtually no evidence upon which to base thedefence was totally irrational and reckless conduct on the part of the Estate trustee,amounting to dissipation of the assets of the overall modest size of the Estate.

[81]

Spending tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees advancing frivolous and

groundless defences either to see to it that Julie Craven saw no or at least theminimal amount of the assets of the Estate or to prevent personal liability fromattaching to Michael Osidacz for legal fees is not a valid basis to “preserve” estateassets and does nothing for the creditors or the beneficiaries of the Estate.

The “modern approach” to awarding estate litigation costs was set out in

Essentially, it incorporates the modern “loser pays” approach to awarding costs oflitigation as follows: “The modern approach to fixing costs in estate litigation is tocarefully scrutinize the litigation and, unless the court finds that one or more of thepublic policy considerations set out above applies, to follow the costs rules thatapply in civil litigation”.

[83]

Such approach displaces the “traditional” approach to costs whereby the

costs of a proceeding were generally paid out of the estate subject to certainexceptions as follows: “The practice of the English courts, in estate litigation, is toorder the costs of all parties to be paid out of the estate where the litigation arose asa result of the actions of the testator, or those with an interest in the residue of theestate, or where the litigation was reasonably necessary to ensure the properadministration of the estate”.
McDougald Estate v. Gooderham, supra

[84]

Essentially, Michael Osidacz ran up his legal bills to a maximum until he

was stopped by an order of this Court. Michael Osidacz exercised dubiousjudgment at best and generally tried to evade responsibility by shifting blame for

the decision of McDougald Estate v. Gooderham, [2005] OJ No. 2432 (CA).

- 34 -

most decisions either to the lawyers, or the legal advice received, or to Julie

[85]

The fact that Michael Osidacz received legal advice, per se, does not

permit him to abdicate his responsibilities as trustee or immunize him from theultimate decisions made. That is especially where, as here, the decisions hepersonally made, including raising unnecessary and unsubstantiated defences –
such as limitation periods, denying obvious claims and asserting that JulieCraven’s injuries were a result of events prior to March 18, 2006, without anyevidentiary basis, had enormous consequences resulting in a situation where theEstate trustee essentially used estate funds to bankroll his legal fees and run up agigantic bill without regard to any of the consequences. I find it would beinequitable to allow Michael Osidacz to have used the assets of the Estate as kindof an ATM machine, from which withdrawals automatically flowed, to fundlitigation that was totally unreasonable.

[86]

Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that there be no indemnity of the legal

costs incurred by Michael Osidacz and that he repay to the Estate the sum of
$91,277.98, save and except for some limited costs which would be reasonablyincurred in relation to the investigation and initial receipt of the claims which I fixat $20,000.00, leaving the amount to be repaid to be $71,277.98.
