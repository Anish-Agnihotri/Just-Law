PERELL, J.
REASONS FOR DECISION

[1]
On April 28, 2016, Heather Estwick (age 49) had a heart attack that injured her brain. Shewas diagnosed with anterograde amnesia; she is unable to retain new memories. She also suffersfrom “frank confabulation,” and unintentionally fabricates information that she believes to betrue.

[2]
On June 30, 2016, Ms. Estwick was transferred from the medical unit to the psychiatricunit at St. Joseph’s Health Centre in Toronto as an involuntary patient. Dr. Marika Younker, apsychiatrist, began treating Ms. Estwick on July 4, 2016.

[3]
On July 13, 2016, during Ms. Estwick’s admission to the psychiatric unit, pursuant to theMental Health Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7, and the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c.30,Dr. Younker found that Ms. Estwick was incapable of managing her property.

[4]
Act:

The test for incapacity to manage property is set out in s. 6 of the Substitute Decisions6. A person is incapable of managing property if the person is not able to understand theinformation that is relevant to making a decision in the management of his or her property, or isnot able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.

[6]
On August 8, 2016, Dr. Younker, as well as an occupational therapist, assessed Ms.Estwick’s capacity to manage property. They determined that Ms. Estwick was unable to identifyher bank, where it was located, and her account PIN number. Ms. Estwick was unable toaccurately report her sources of income and the amount of her expenses. At times, she wasunable to give her own address or phone number. Ms. Estwick, who is impoverished andreceiving social assistance, confabulated assertions that she was wealthy from lottery prizes andinheritances. The therapist and Dr. Younker found that Ms. Estwick was incapable of managingproperty.

[7]
As a result of these assessments, on August 8, 2016, Dr. Younker issued a Certificate ofContinuance with respect to the finding of incapacity.

[8]

On August 11, 2016, Ms. Estwick was discharged from the Health Centre.

[9]
Ms. Estwick appealed the finding of incapacity to the Board, which held a hearing onSeptember 27, 2016.

[10] Dr. Younker and Ms. Estwick's partner, John Stephenson, testified at the hearing.
Numerous exhibits were entered into evidence including an Occupational Therapy In-PatientFunctional Report dated August 8, 2016 and Dr. Younker's detailed discharge summary datedAugust 19, 2016.

[11] At the hearing, Dr. Younker testified that Ms. Estwick’s condition and cognition had notimproved during her admission to the Health Centre and, given the nature of the brain injury,improvement was not to be expected. Dr. Younker was unequivocal that Ms. Estwick did nothave capacity to manage her property.

[12] On September 27, 2016, the Board confirmed Dr. Younker’s finding of incapacity
(Reasons for Decision dated October 3, 2016). The Board found that Dr. Younker had proventhat at the time of the hearing Ms. Estwick was incapable of managing property. The Boardnoted that Dr. Younker's finding that Ms. Estwick had significant memory impairment and thatshe confabulated was corroborated by a neurologist and two occupational therapists who hadseen Ms. Estwick. The Board found that Ms. Estwick was unable to understand the informationrelevant to making a decision about the management of property. The Board concluded that Ms.Estwick's symptoms left her without the ability to understand relevant information about makingdecisions because she could not retain information long enough to evaluate it and she believedher fabrications to be true.

[13]

Ms. Estwick appeals the Board’s decision to this court.

[14] Reasonableness is the standard of appellate review that applies to the decisions of anadministrative tribunal like the Consent and Capacity Board, including its decisions interpretingits home statute. The Board is a specialized tribunal entitled to deference on matters within itsexpertise including factual determinations on capacity issues. See: Ackie v. Manocha, 2014
ONSC 669; McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2013 SCC 67; Alberta

[5]
Ms. Estwick appealed the finding of incapacity to the Consent and Capacity Board,which in a decision dated July 22, 2016, upheld Dr. Younker’s decision. As a result of thefindings of incapacity, the Public Guardian and Trustee assumed control of Ms. Estwick’sproperty.

[15] In my opinion, the Board properly considered the evidence before it, and it reasonablyconcluded that Ms. Estwick was incapable of managing property. There is no merit to Ms.Estwick’s arguments that the Board relied on stale information and that incapacity was notproven at the time of the hearing. There is no merit to Ms. Estwick’s arguments that the Boardfailed to consider or failed to give proper weight to the evidence of Mr. Stephenson and that iterred in concluding that his evidence did not refute Dr. Younker’s conclusion that Ms. Estwickwas incapable of managing property.

[16] Relying on Khan v. St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 303 (CA), leaveto appeal to SCC refused [1992] S.C.C.A. No. 319, Ms. Estwick argues that the Board erred byfailing to take into account that given her poverty, the management of her property was notcomplex. In the Khan case, the patient refused to inquire about the extent of her property, and thecourt did not address the significance, if any, of the extent of a person’s property to his or herability to manage it, and rather addressed whether the Board applied the proper test to determinethe patient’s capacity to manage the property. More to the point, in the immediate case, theBoard was manifestly aware that Ms. Estwick had no property to speak of and that she hadextremely modest sources of income. The Board came to the reasonable conclusion that whetherthe property was negligible or great, Ms. Estwick was incapable of managing it.

[17] The Board’s decision to confirm Dr. Younker’s finding of incapacity was reasonable andsupported by the evidence. I dismiss the appeal without costs.
