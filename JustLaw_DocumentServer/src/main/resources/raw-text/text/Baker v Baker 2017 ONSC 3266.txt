REASONS FOR DECISION
ENGELKING J.

[1]
This is a Motion to Change the order of Justice P. Annis dated October 23, 2012, broughtby the Respondent, Ms. Baker, in October of 2016 in which she is seeking increased retroactiveand ongoing spousal support on the basis that there has been a material change of circumstancesrelating to the income of the Applicant, Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker, for his part, disputes Ms. Baker’sclaim and counterclaims that there has been a material change of circumstances relating to themarital status of Ms. Baker, and he seeks a reduction in the spousal support payable by him.
Issues

[2]

The issues to be determined on the motion to change are:
1) Did Mr. Baker fail to comply with the order of Justice Annis of October 23, 2012, bynot providing Ms. Baker with his Notices of Assessment for 2012, 2013, and 2014
prior to August of 2015?
2) If so, does this failure result in a material change in circumstances?

ONTARIO

3) Does Mr. Baker’s 2012 severance payment constitute income for the purposescalculating spousal support?

5) Does Mr. Baker’s post-order employment income constitute a material change suchthat spousal support should be retroactively and proactively increased?
6) Does Ms. Baker’s 2014 marriage constitute a material change such that spousalsupport should be proactively decreased?
Facts Relevant to the Issues

[3]

The facts that give rise to this motion are as follows:
1)

The parties were married on August 26, 1978, and separated on August 22, 2001.
They were divorced in 2005. There were three children of the marriage, all of whomare now independent.

2)

The parties entered into a comprehensive Separation Agreement which is datedApril 30, 2002.

3)

In 2004, Mr. Baker brought a Motion to Change the separation agreement, the resultof which was an order by Justice Sheffield dated December 1, 2004.

4)

In 2010, Ms. Baker brought a Motion to Change the order of Justice Sheffield, whichwas resolved by Minutes of Settlement and a consent order by Justice Kershmandated February 15, 2011.

5)

In 2012, Mr. Baker brought a Motion to Change the order of Justice Kershman on thebasis that he would be retiring in 2012. That motion was resolved by Minutes ofSettlement and a consent order of Justice Annis dated October 23, 2012.

6)

This Motion to Change is brought by Ms. Baker seeking to vary the order ofJustice Annis on the basis that Mr. Baker received a severance payment and unusedvacation payout in 2012, which should have been included in his income for thepurpose of calculating spousal support for 2012, and on the basis that Mr. Baker hasemployment income from 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, which should have and shouldstill be included in his income for the purpose of calculating spousal support.

7)

The result of the 2012 negotiations was that the parties agreed that the spousalsupport to be paid by Mr. Baker was reduced from $7,460 per month to $5,748 permonth based on the portion of his pension income that had not been equalized at thetime of the separation agreement, or $179,172 per year, with the amount of these

4) How is the release contained in paragraph 63 of the parties’ April 30, 2002,Separation Agreement to be interpreted?

3

8)

The order of Justice Annis included the following provision at paragraph 4: “Eachyear, on May 1st commencing May 1, 2013, the applicant shall provide theRespondent with written evidence of any increase in his pension and a copy of hisnotice of Assessment.”

9)

Mr. Baker has paid said spousal support, has consistently provided information toMs. Baker regarding the indexation of his pension, and did increase said supportfrom 2012 such that his current spousal support payments are $6,050 per month.

10)

Mr. Baker did not provide Ms. Baker with copies of his Notices of Assessmentpost-2012, until he was asked for them in the early summer of 2015, at which time heproduced them. When asked in questioning about that, Mr. Baker indicated that hehad simply overlooked that requirement. His precise answer to the question ofwhether he had provided them was:
“When your request came to me, I obviously checked and I had notnoticed that. This is the first time since our separation going backto the original separation agreement and all of the amendmentsthat have been made since, that that requirement was there. I [sic]
was just something I had overlooked. I was always focused onmaking sure the correct payment were made.” (Lines 12 to 19,page 16, Questioning of the Witness William Victor Baker onJanuary 11, 2017).

11)

Mr. Baker received payments for severance on February 28, 2012 and March 1, 2012
and for vacation pay on April 10, 2012.

12)

Mr. Baker’s line 150 income for 2012 was thus $476,342, which included his incomefrom January to April, his severance/vacation pay and his unequalized pensionincome post-April.

13)

Additionally, Mr. Baker was approached by the Government of Canada in 2014 tochair two committees, for which work he was remunerated. Mr. Baker indicated thathe also had a couple of small “consulting” contracts for which he receivedremuneration. The end result was that his line 150 income was:
a) for 2013 - $217,183;b) for 2014 - $289,015; and,c) for 2015 - $297,532;

14)

For 2016, Mr. Baker indicates that he chaired the two committees only, and hisemployment income is estimated at $42,000, which is made up of $32,080 from his

payments to be increased May 1st of every year by the percentage increase inMr. Baker’s pension.

4
T4 for 2016, and another approximately $10,000 which was invoiced in 2016, but notpaid out before 2017.

[4]
Ms. Baker’s position is that Mr. Baker failed to comply with the order of Justice Annis,intentionally or otherwise, with respect to providing his Notices of Assessments annually, andthat had she known of the severance payment and the unused vacation pay-out that occurredimmediately pre-retirement, she would not have settled for the reduction in spousal support thatshe did. Mr. Baker’s failure to disclose, Ms. Baker argues, constitutes a material change ofcircumstances in relation to spousal support payable to her in 2012.

[5]
Additionally, it is Ms. Baker’s position that Mr. Baker’s post-retirement incomeconstitutes a material change of circumstances, and again, had she known of it prior to 2015; shewould have sought adjustments to her spousal support accordingly. Ms. Baker seeks retroactivespousal support from May to December of 2012, calculated on the basis of Mr. Baker’s 2012
income, including his severance package, at the mid-range of the SSAG’s. Additionally, sheseeks retroactive and on-going support calculated based on the additional income of Mr. Bakerfor the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and on-going. She does not seek an adjustment for 2013 based onthe fact that Mr. Baker’s additional income for that year was minimal (approximately $6,000).

[6]
Mr. Baker’s position is that his severance payment and unused vacation pay-out wereexempted pursuant to the parties Separation Agreement dated April 30, 2002, and that becausehe retired effective April 27, 2012, his only employment income for 2012 was earned betweenJanuary and April. His position, further, is that his severance package and vacation pay-out weredisclosed and considered at the time of the October 2012 Minutes of Settlement and ConsentOrder.

[7]
Mr. Baker’s position with respect to his post retirement income is that there has been amaterial change in circumstances, namely Ms. Baker’s marriage to Mr. Fulford in 2014, whichshould reduce his obligation, and that, additionally, Ms. Baker’s choice not to work should betaken into consideration in determining whether his post retirement income, that he did not seekout, should be shared with her. Mr. Baker is not of the view that Ms. Baker should be required towork, or that an income should be imputed to her, only that her decision not to work at all, andher current financial security with Mr. Fulford, should be taken into consideration in all of thecircumstances.
AnalysisIssue #1: Did Mr. Baker fail to comply with the order of Justice Annis of October 23, 2012, bynot providing Ms. Baker with his Notices of Assessment for 2012, 2013, and 2014 prior to Julyof 2015?
Issue #2: If so, does this failure constitute a material change in circumstances?

The Positions of the Parties

[8]
Mr. Baker readily admits that he did not send his Notices of Assessments post the 2012
order to Ms. Baker every May, as he did the information on the percentage adjustment of hispension. According to his evidence, this was an oversight and not intentional, as he had not beenrequired to provide it before pursuant to the parties’ original agreement and various amendments.
While I cannot find that Mr. Baker intentionally failed to disclose, he did, nevertheless, fail toadhere to the order of Justice Annis in this regard.

[9]
The parties entered into a separation agreement in 2002 whereby they resolved all issuesrelating to custody, access and child support in relation to the then three children of the marriage,equalization of family property, and spousal support. Mr. Baker’s pension was equalized as aresult of that agreement, and additional monies were paid to Ms. Baker as an equalizationpayment. Because Mr. Baker’s pension had been equalized, at the time that the Minutes ofSettlement were entered into in October of 2012, spousal support was being calculated on theunequalized portion of his pension only effective May 1, 2012. Mr. Baker did not include hisseverance pay or his unused vacation payout in coming to that calculation, although he hasindicated that both were disclosed and considered at the time of the negotiations.

[10] Although counsel for Ms. Baker submitted that she had no idea about Mr. Baker’sseverance pay in 2012, Ms. Baker says only at paragraph 11 of her affidavit sworn on November3, 2016: “I repeat that when I settled in 2012 on the basis of the Applicant’s representation thathe was retiring in April of 2012 and would not have additional income from employment, I
accepted his advice as truth and had I known that he would continue to earn income fromemployment, I would not have settled to significantly reduce my income.” Ms. Baker does notstate in her affidavit that she was specifically not aware of Mr. Baker’s severance and accruedvacation pay prior to his retirement in April of 2012. However, in support of the contention thatshe was not, Ms. Baker’s counsel relied upon a Financial Statement sworn by Mr. Baker on June21, 2012, which did not include any information with respect to the money Mr. Baker receivedfor severance and accrued vacation pay.

[11] Mr. Baker, on the other hand, stated at paragraph 14 of his affidavit sworn on December5, 2016; “My only employment income in 2012 was earned during the months of January toApril, plus severance pay, all of which had been disclosed and considered in the October, 2012
Minutes of Settlement. I did not earn any employment income in 2012 after the Minutes ofSettlement.” (Emphasis is original). Mr. Baker’s counsel submitted, moreover, that this statementof Mr. Baker’s was not refuted in the affidavit of Ms. Baker in response sworn on January 3,2017. Nor was Mr. Baker questioned on it when he attended for questioning.

[12] Based on the evidence before me, I cannot make a definitive finding of fact thatMs. Baker knew about Mr. Baker’s severance payments in 2012. Certainly, had Mr. Bakercomplied with the order of Justice Annis, Ms. Baker would have known about them in May of2013, as opposed to August of 2015, as she states. Additionally, had Mr. Baker included theinformation in his June 21, 2012 Financial Statement, the parties and the court would have beenclear on the fact that it existed and was disclosed prior to the consent order. Mr. Baker’sstatement in his affidavit that it was disclosed prior to the October 2012 settlement is nothingmore than a bold assertion with no documentation to corroborate it, such as copies ofcorrespondence or email exchanges between counsel. It is, thus, likely that Ms. Baker was not

5

aware of the exact payments Mr. Baker received in severance and accrued vacation pay in 2012.
Had I clear evidence that Mr. Baker disclosed the information at the time of the negotiations, itwould not constitute a material change. However, based on the lack of same, and the absence ofany information of the funds having been received in the Financial Statement of Mr. Bakersworn on June 21, 2012, I must find that the existence of the actual severance payments inFebruary and March of 2012 were unknown to Ms. Baker at the time of the negotiations andconstitute a material change of circumstances.
Issue #3: Do Mr. Baker’s 2012 severance payment and unused vacation pay-out constituteincome for the purposes calculating spousal support?
Issue #4: How is the release contained in paragraph 63 of the parties’ April 30, 2002,Separation Agreement to be interpreted?

[13] Regardless of whether Ms. Baker knew or didn’t know, Mr. Baker states that based onparagraph 63 of the parties’ April 30, 2002 Separation Agreement, his severance pay and accruedvacation pay were exempted from inclusion in any event. Firstly, the definition of Mr. Baker’ssalary for the purposes of calculating support as contained in paragraph 1.(j) of the agreementprovides as follows:
(j) “husband’s salary’ shall, for the purposes of child and spousal support, meanthe husband’s base salary, exclusive of cashed-in leave and any employmentbonus in a year provided the employment bonus does not exceed 20% of his basincome. If the husband’s bonus does exceed 20% then the excess amount shall beincluded in the calculation of his income for purposes of determining the amountof child support payable and may constitute a material change in circumstancesfor variation proceedings.

[14] Secondly, paragraph 63 of the Separation Agreement provides as follows under theheading “Pension Release”:
63. Except as provided in this Agreement and notwithstanding any designation tothe contrary which may predate this agreement, neither the husband nor the wifeshall be entitled to share or to receive any benefits of any kind from any pensionof the other, including but not limited to any company or employment pensionplans, deferred profit sharing plans, registered retirement savings plans, registeredhome ownership plans, vacation pay and severance pay. (Emphasis added).

[15] Clearly, pursuant to paragraph 1. (j) of the Separation Agreement, the parties agreed thatpayment for Mr. Baker’s accrued vacation would not form part of his income for the purposes ofthe spousal support calculation.

[16] The agreement is less clear as it relates to Mr. Baker’s severance pay. While all of theitems listed in paragraph 63 of the agreement constitute property, they are all also potentiallyincome generating. While it is clear that the spouses are releasing each other from any pensionlike property claims, the specific inclusion in that paragraph of “vacation pay and severance

[17] Ms. Baker relies upon two things in support of her position that Mr. Baker’s severancepay should form part of his 2012 income:No.1262 (Alta. C.A.)

[18]
1.

Mr. Baker relies upon two things to suggest it should not:
Both Miller, supra and the case to which it referred, MacDonald, supra, were childsupport cases, and there was no evidence in either of waiver (as between spouses)
equivalent to paragraph 63 of the parties’ separation agreement, and;

2.

Ms. Baker, in paragraph 63, specifically waived any benefit she might receive fromMr. Baker’s severance or accrued vacation pay.

[19]
Having carefully reviewed the Separation Agreement, I conclude that the parties werewaiving their rights to make future property claims regarding those items listed in paragraph 63.
Firstly, they are in a section entitled “Pension Release”, which is immediately preceded by oneentitled “Release Against Property”, and followed by one entitled “Release Against the Estate ofthe Other”. They are in a part of the agreement that is dealing with property releases.

[20] Second, the agreement did not include any provision in either the definition section or thespousal support section that would make it clear that it was the anticipation of the parties thatMr. Baker’s severance pay would be specifically excluded from his income for the purposes ofcalculating support. Had they intended that to be the case, a provision to that effect could havebeen included (as it was for “cashed-in leave”). It was not.

[21] Thus, based on Miller, supra, Mr. Baker’s severance pay does form part of his income forthe purposes of calculating spousal support.

pay”, coupled with the prohibition from either the husband or the wife being entitled “to share orto receive any benefits of any kind”, does raise the question of whether they were waiving anyright to those as income as well.

8

a) The exact sum paid to Mr. Baker as severance pay in 2012;b) What portion of that sum was or may have been equalized at the time ofthe parties’ separation;c) The exact sum of vacation pay Mr. Baker received in 2012; and,d) What Mr. Baker’s taxation rate was in 2012?

[23]

On May 15, 2017, I received a joint submission from the parties indicating:
a) The exact sum paid to Mr. Baker as severance in 2012 was $132,890.00;b) The portion of that sum equalized was $41,739.00;c) The exact sum of vacation pay Mr. Baker received in 2012 was
$41,664.00; and,d) The taxation rate for Mr. Baker in 2012 was 40.9%.

[24] Based on the above, the amount of Mr. Baker’s unequalized severance pay was $91,151.
That sum divided by the twelve months of 2012 equals $7,595.92, multiplied by eight for themonths of May through December equals $60,767.36. Thus, the sum of $60,767 should be addedto Mr. Baker’s annual income of $179,172 for a sum of $239,939 for May through December2012.

[25] Based on the parties’ 2002 Separation Agreement and subsequent amendments/orders, I
find that support should continue at the mid-range of the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
On an annual income of $239,939 for Mr. Baker and $0 for Ms. Baker, spousal support would bepayable in the mid-range of $8,048 per month. Pursuant to the order of Annis, J., Mr. Baker wasto pay Ms. Baker $5,748 per month from May to December of 2012. The deficit is $2,300 permonth, for a total of $18,400. However, Mr. Baker was subject to a taxation rate of 40.9% in2012. Taking his tax liability into account, the total amount now owing would be $10,875.
Issue #5: Does Mr. Baker’s post-order employment income constitute a material change suchthat spousal support should be retroactively and proactively increased?

[26] As was indicated above, Mr. Baker was approached by the Government of Canada in2014 to chair two audit committees. His appointments to same were done by the Treasury Board,

[22] While Mr. Baker’s Notice of Assessment for 2012 which showed a line 150 income of
$476,342 was filed with the court, neither party provided specifics with respect to the actual sumMr. Baker received as severance pay in their evidentiary materials. On May 9, 2017, I thusreleased an endorsement which required the parties to provide in a joint submission the followinginformation:

and were for a four year terms, namely 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In 2014 and 2015, Mr. Bakeralso had some brief contracts that generated some income. At the time of his retirement, andduring the ensuing negotiations, it was clear that Mr. Baker had no intention to seek employmentpost-retirement. Indeed, he did not seek it; it sought him. However, again based on thenon-disclosure of his Notices of Assessment, the fact that Mr. Baker was making post-retirementincome would have come as a surprize to Ms. Baker in 2015, and does constitute a materialchange of circumstances from the time at which she was negotiating the 2012 order.

[27] This case can be distinguished somewhat from that of Slongo v. Slongo, 2017 ONCA
272, in that Mr. Slongo immediately starting working by contract doing the essentially same jobpost-retirement as he did pre-retirement. While Mr. Baker did a very small contract in 2013, hedid not begin to chair the audit committees until 2014, and the work was not the same as he hadbeen engaged in pre-retirement. Nevertheless, he was undoubtedly approached to fulfill thoseroles as a result of the experience and reputation he gained during his working life, to whichMs. Baker substantially contributed. That she should share in those gains, to the degree that theyform part of his line 150 income, is only logical.

[28] I find that Mr. Baker’s employment income for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was $41,580,
$64,717.29, $42,000 and $42,000 respectively.
Issue #6: Does Ms. Baker’s 2014 marriage constitute a material change such that spousalsupport should be proactively decreased?

[29] Mr. Baker was clearly aware by the time of the 2012 negotiations that Ms. Baker wascohabiting with Mr. Fulford, and had been doing so since June of that year. I do not find thatMs. Baker marrying Mr. Fulford in 2014 constitutes a material change of circumstances.
