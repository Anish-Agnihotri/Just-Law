REASONS FOR DECISION
OVERVIEW

[1]

The Municipality of West Nipissing (“West Nipissing”) applies under s. 440 of theMunicipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 25 for an injunction restraining the respondents, PierreLafond and Maurice Poisson, from operating an automobile repair shop at 567 DutrisacRoad (“567”), in Sturgeon Falls.

[2]

The central issue is whether Mr. Lafond was operating the shop at the time the presentby-law prohibiting such an operation came into effect. If so, a second issue arises as to

ONTARIO

[3]

For the following reasons, I find that the respondents have failed to establish that Mr.Lafond was operating an automobile repair shop at 567 at the time the present by-lawwas enacted. I also find that they have failed to establish that the shop operatedcontinuously afterwards.

[4]

West Nipissing is entitled, therefore, to the injunction it seeks.
BACKGROUND

[5]

Most of the facts in this matter are not in dispute. What is in dispute are the conclusionsto be drawn from those facts.

[6]

Mr. Lafond purchased the property at 567 along with another person on September 5,2008. In November 2010, the property was transferred into his name alone.

[7]

At the request of Mr. Lafond, West Nipissing amended zoning by-law 86-4 in 2009 toallow him to establish and operate a towing business out of a garage he had constructedon the property.
Following the enactment of the amending by-law (2009/16), thepermitted uses at 567 included use as a “home industry”. Under s. 2.54 of by-law 86-4, ahome industry expressly included an “auto repair shop”, providing that certain otherconditions were met.1

[8]

In 2013, a dispute arose between West Nipissing and Mr. Lafond after it was discoveredthat Mr. Lafond had erected a large “cover-all” structure on a vacant lot he owns next to567 without obtaining a building permit. West Nipissing was concerned that the towingbusiness no longer conformed to the definition of a home industry in by-law 86-4. Thedispute was resolved when Mr. Lafond agreed to move the towing business to propertyhe purchased elsewhere within West Nipissing. The towing business, Lafond’s Towingand Recovery Ltd., was moved in or about the month of November 2015.

[9]

On July 8, 2014, West Nipissing enacted a new zoning by-law, by-law 2014-45. Unlikeby-law 86-4, by-law 2014-45 expressly excluded “the repairing of motor vehicles” as ahome industry. For the sake of these reasons, I will refer to the business of repairingmotor vehicles as the operation of an auto repair shop.

[10]

On July 22, 2016, West Nipissing received a complaint that Mr. Lafond was operating anauto repair shop at 567 in contravention of by-law 2014-45. Subsequent investigationrevealed that an auto repair shop was indeed being operated at 567, under the name
“Moe’s Auto Repairs”. Mr. Lafond alleges that he owns the business and that he has oneemployee, the respondent, Mr. Poisson.

1

A towing business is not expressly referred to in s. 2.54. However, the section defines a home industry as meaning
“a gainful occupation, including…” Obviously, the parties interpreted the section as permitting a towing business.

whether he has continuously operated the shop subsequent to the enactment of the bylaw.

There is no dispute between the parties that the business presently being operated at 567
involves the repairing of motor vehicles and would otherwise contravene the provisionsof by-law 2014-45 unless it is a legal non-conforming use in the sense of being an autorepair shop that was in existence before by-law 2014-45 was enacted and has operatedcontinuously since.
ISSUES

[12]

Three issues arise in this application:
(1)

Who has the onus of proving a legal non-conforming use, and to what standard?

(2)

Was there an auto repair shop operating at 567 at the time by-law 2014-45 wasenacted?

(3)

If so, has the auto repair shop operated continuously since?
ANALYSIS

Who has the onus?

[13]

Section 34(9) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13 allows the use of property tocontinue notwithstanding a change in zoning providing that the use was lawful prior tothe enactment of the prohibiting by-law. It reads:
(9) No by-law passed under this section applies,
(a) to prevent the use of any land, building or structure for anypurpose prohibited by the by-law if such land, building or structurewas lawfully used for such purpose on the day of the passing of theby-law, so long as it continues to be used for that purpose; or
(b) to prevent the erection or use for a purpose prohibited by theby-law of any building or structure for which a permit has beenissued under subsection 8 (1) of the Building Code Act, 1992, priorto the day of the passing of the by-law, so long as the building orstructure when erected is used and continues to be used for thepurpose for which it was erected and provided the permit has notbeen revoked under subsection 8 (10) of that Act.

[14]

The respondents submit that they have no onus “to establish the existence of a nonconforming use”. As I understand their argument, they submit that West Nipissing hasthe onus of proving that no auto repair shop was being operated at 567 prior to thepassage of by-law 2014-45 and that it has not been operating continuously since then. I
disagree.

[11]

[15]
I would have thought that when a municipal authority is seeking byway of an action for an injunction to prevent an owner fromenjoying the use of his property, it must satisfy the Court that it hasan overriding right to do so. It will not suffice that it simply file aby-law with the Court. On the whole case, it has the basic onus ofproving its entitlement to relief. My brother, Steele J. said as muchin City of Toronto v. San Joaquin Investments Ltd. et al (1978),1978 CanLII 1576 (ON SC), 18 O.R. (2d) 730 at 739, 83 D.L.R.D.L.R. (3d) 546, 11 M.P.L.R. 83].

[16]

In the case of San Joaquin Investments, to which Smith J. referred, the court held that theonus is on the party against whom an injunction is sought to prove a legal nonconforming use. At p. 739 of the decision, Steele J. wrote:
The basic onus is upon the plaintiff to prove his case, particularlyso when the relief sought is the extraordinary remedy of aninjunction.
There is an onus upon a defendant to prove that he has anexemption to a by-law which proof must go not only to the use ofthe lands of the time of the amendment to the by-law but also to itscontinued use until the time of the issuance of the writ. Bearingthese principles in mind I must consider the conflicting evidencethat is before me.

[17]

As I read San Joaquin Investments, the onus is on the municipality to prove that the useto which the property is presently being put contravenes the current by-law. Once thatonus has been met, the onus shifts to the party against whom the injunction is sought.
This was the ruling in Toronto (City) v. Gallos, 2008 ONCA 617 [In Chambers], 51
M.P.L.R. (4th) 157. In Gallos, Simmons J.A. wrote, at paras. 62-63:
As the justice of the peace observed, the applicant bearsthe onus of proving that he is entitled to legal non-conforming usestatus for the size of his restaurant: see s. 47(3) of the ProvincialOffences Act; Toronto (City) v. San Joaquin InvestmentsLtd. (1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 730 (Ont. H.C.). The applicant does notdispute this proposition.

[18]

There is no dispute in this case that the present use of the property at 567 contravenes thegoverning by-law. Therefore, the onus of proving a legal non-conforming use is on therespondents. However, the respondents also argue that any burden they may have is onlyan evidential burden, not a persuasive one. They rely on the following further commentsof Smith J. in Emily concerning the decision in San Joaquin Investments, which followedthe comments set out above:(ON SC), 22 O.R. (2d) 779, 93 D.L.R. (3d) 145, said at p. 782
O.R.:
It has been said that any doubt as to prior use should beresolved in favour of the owner…

[19]

The respondents also rely on similar comments made by Russell J. in Paradise (Town) v.

[20]

With respect, Smith J.’s assumption that the responding party need only adduce someevidence was incorrect.

[21]
Nonetheless, [the justice of the peace’s] findings of guilt cannotstand because she applied the wrong standard of proof. Shecorrectly held that the defendants bore the onus to establish a nonconforming use. However, she held that the defendants must do soon the criminal standard, that is they must prove a lawful nonconforming use beyond a reasonable doubt. She wrote:
The defence relies on numerous cases including the caseof Central Jewish Institute v. Toronto which deals with alegal non-conforming use.
In order to accept thisargument, the Court would have to accept that the evidence

Accordingly, once the City led evidence that the applicant'srestaurant exceeded 165 square metres of non-residential grossfloor area as defined in By-law 1996-0332, the applicant borethe onus of proving that he was entitled to a legal nonconforming use.

This was a fundamental error. The defendants need only prove alegal non-conforming use on a balance of probabilities.
SeeToronto (City) v. San Joaquin Investments Ltd. (1978), 18 O.R.
(2d) 730 at 739 (Ont. H.C.); aff'd on other grounds (1979), 26 O.R.
(2d) 775 (Ont. Div. Ct.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1980),26 O.R. (2d) 775 (note) (Ont. Div. Ct.); and Sudbury (RegionalMunicipality) v. Canapini Brothers Ltd. (November 17, 1990),Doc. Sudbury 216/89 (Ont. Gen. Div.).

[22]

In a subsequent decision of this court, Howden J. wrote in Rotstein v. Oro-MedonteTo establish lawful status, Section 34(9) requires, proof to a civilstandard of:
i)
lawful use of any land, building or structure at the time ofenactment of the relevant zoning restriction, andii)
its continuance thereafter.(Mun.) v. Reeve (2000), 14 MPLR (3d) 256 at 263 (Ont.
C.A.). Rogers, Canadian Law of Planning and Zoning, pp.210.25.26. It is for the party alleging s. 34(9) protection to establish bothelements to a civil standard of proof.

[23]

Clearly, the onus on the respondents goes beyond an obligation merely to introduceevidence and requires them to prove on a balance of probabilities that the use at the timethe prohibiting by-law came into effect conformed to the previous permitting by-law andwas continuous to the time of the application.

Was 567 being used as an auto repair shop at the time by-law 2014-45 was enacted?

[24]

The respondents submit that Moe’s Auto Repairs is just a variant of an auto repair shopthat Mr. Lafond was operating at the time by-law 2014-45 was enacted on July 8, 2014.
Mr. Lafond deposes that he operated both a towing business and an auto repair shop at567, beginning in October 2009. He says that when he moved the towing business in2015, he left the auto repair shop where it was. His evidence is that, prior to July 8, 2014,he performed auto repairs at 567 and employed one employee (Louis Lafond) on a full-

presented by the defence has shown beyond a reasonabledoubt that they fall within the requirements of a legal nonconforming use and based on the evidence before the Courtthe defence has not met the requirement of showing acontinuous use.

[25]

Mr. Lafond deposes that in February 2016, he began to employ Mr. Poisson on acommission basis and that the business has operated on that basis since then.

[26]

I do not accept Mr. Lafond’s conclusion that he was operating an auto repair shop at 567
prior to July 8, 2014. Instead, I have concluded that he was performing occasionalrepairs to vehicles as an incidental activity to towing. In reaching this conclusion, I relyon the evidence set out below.
Business Name

[27]

Throughout the entire period from 2009 until July 8, 2014, the business being operated at567 was known as “Lafond’s Towing and Recovery”. Nothing in that name identifies thebusiness as an auto repair shop.
Advertising

[28]

During his cross-examination on February 15, 2017, Mr. Lafond testified that he neveradvertised Lafond’s Towing and Recovery as an auto repair shop. He testified that theauto business “wasn’t the mainstream of our business” (p. 59, q. 287)
Signage

[29]

Section 60 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sch. A, requires thata supplier who works on or repairs vehicles post the prescribed signs. Ontario Regulation17/05 sets out the information that those signs must display. No such signs were everposted at Lafond’s Towing and Recovery. Indeed, Mr. Lafond testified during his crossexamination on February 15, 2017, that he was unaware of his duties under the governinglegislation (p. 57, q. 274).
Licensed Mechanics

[30]

Lafond’s Towing and Recovery employed no licensed mechanics prior to hiring Mr.Poisson in February, 2016. Mr. Lafond testified during cross-examination on December9, 2016, that the two employees working for him prior to July 8, 2014, worked only ontow trucks.
Repairs to Lafond’s Own Vehicles

[31]

In March or June 2015, Lafond’s Towing and Recovery was inspected by an enforcementofficer with Ontario College of Trades (“OCOT”). The inspection report prepared withrespect to that visit, a copy of which was produced by Mr. Lafond, contains the followingexcerpt:

time basis and another employee (Sean Turpin) on a part-time basis, in conformity withby-law 86-4.

[32]

During his cross-examination on December 9, 2016, Mr. Lafond testified that OCOT wasconcerned about his drivers, none of whom was licensed, doing work that only a licensedmechanic was permitted to do (p. 42, q. 288).

[33]

Mr. Lafond appended a number of photographs to an affidavit he swore on January 31,2017. These photographs are described in his affidavit as “photographs of trucks beingrepaired at 567… on April 11, 2012 and November 4, 2012”. With one exception, thetrucks being repaired belonged to Lafond’s Towing and Recovery. The exception relatesto a grey tractor trailer, which one photo shows was towed to Lafond’s Towing andRecovery by one of its vehicles. Whereas the other photographs clearly show repairsbeing undertaken to the Lafond vehicles, the photograph depicting the grey tractor traileralone does not. In any event, these photographs do nothing more than show that repairswere performed at Lafond’s Towing and Recovery either on its own vehicles orincidentally as part of its towing business.
Insurance

[34]

As part of the discovery process, Mr. Lafond produced insurance policies for the years2012, 2014 and 2016. The policies for 2012 and 2014 identify the insured business as
“Towing Company – Impound and Freight Broker”. The 2014 policy identifies theinsured business as “Motor Carrier – Hauling Goods of Others”. None of the policies forthese years describe the business as one involving auto repairs.

[35]

Even in February 2016, the month in which Mr. Poisson is alleged to have begun to workas an employee of Mr. Lafond’s, the policy refers to the nature of the business as “IceRecovery Operations”.

[36]

It was not until October or November 2016 that the first insurance policy produced withrespect to “Moe’s Auto Repairs” described the business as “Auto Repair Garage”.
Workplace Safety

[37]

Mr. Lafond produced three Workplace Safety & Insurance Board Premium RemittanceForms which were filed in connection with Lafond’s Towing and Recovery in 2011. Allthree of those forms described the insured business as “Towing Services”. Again, noreference was made in the forms to the operation of an auto repair shop.
Income Tax Returns

[38]

Mr. Lafond produced his individual income tax returns for the years 2008, 2010 and2012. These tax returns all describe the nature of Mr. Lafond’s business income as

Mr. Lafond explained that he periodically performs regularmaintenance including greasing of his trucks, but that there is nocompulsory trade work performed in the course of his businessoperations. Mr. Lafond takes his trucks to a licenced mechanic forrepair and maintenance as needed.

Zoning Amendment Application

[39]

In April 2014, Mr. Lafond completed a zoning amendment application. Although it isnot clear from the materials, I assume that this document was completed as part of aneffort by Mr. Lafond to resolve the concerns that arose in 2013 as to whether his businesscomplied with by-law 86-4. In the application, he sought to rezone 567 from residentialdensity (R1) to industrial. In s. 6.5 of the application, in response to a question as towhether the property had ever been used for commercial or industrial purposes, thefollowing appears:
Being used for a towing company since 2009.

[40]

Mr. Lafond said nothing in the application with respect to the operation of an auto repairshop on the property.
Invoices

[41]

Mr. Lafond was requested to produce invoices for auto repair work performed at 567. Hewas only able to produce 12 invoices with respect to repairs performed prior to February2016. With only two exceptions, all of these invoices indicate that vehicles were towedfrom one location to another (usually to 567, often at the request of a police service). Thetwo exceptions relate to flat tires. It appears from both invoices that, rather than towing avehicle that had merely suffered a flat tire, the tire was repaired at the location of thedisabled vehicle.

[42]

The services reflected in the invoices ranged from fixing the flat tires referred to above torepairing alternators and damaged oil pans. All of the repairs appear to have beenincidental to the towing of the vehicles referred to in the invoices.
Admission

[43]

All of the evidence to which I have referred leads to the conclusion that the auto repairsperformed at 567 prior to the towing business being moved were only incidental to thatbusiness. Mr. Lafond admitted this during his cross-examination on December 9, 2016.
At that time, he testified, beginning at p. 39, q. 268:
Q.
What kind of mechanical work were you doing at Five SixSeven (567)?
A.
We would fix all of my trucks, depending if it’s warrantywork, and we would do minor repairs for someone on vehicles thatwould be stranded on the highway to help them get along.

“Towing and Recovering”. He also produced the corporate tax returns for Lafond’sTowing and Recovery for the tax years ending 2013, 2014 and 2015. These tax returnsall describe the nature of the business as “Motor Vehicle Towing”. All of these corporatetax returns indicate that 100% of the business’ income is from “Trucking and Towing”.

Q.
So if you towed somebody in -- because you’d be called forthe towing job I presume.
Yes.

Q.
Okay. So you would tow them in, and if they needed abattery or if they needed a new hose or something to get them ontheir way, that’s what you’d do for them; something like that?
A.

Yeah, if nobody could fix them, yes.

Q.

You mean if they couldn’t get fixed on the highway?

A.
No, but there’s a couple of local garages. If they couldn’tsee them and -- I could fix them up, then --.
Q.
So if the garage down the street wasn’t open, or in town,you’d see what you could do for them?
A.

[44]

Yes.

In order for the present use of the property at 567 to be a legal non-conforming use, itmust be the same or substantially the same as the conforming use was at the time theprohibiting by-law came into effect. In The Corporation of the Township of Uxbridge v.
Talbot, 2014 ONSC 1276, 21 M.P.L.R. (5th) 248, Healey J. summarized the approach tobe taken by the court when considering the nature of the use of property before and afterthe passage of a prohibiting by-law. At paras. 52-53, she wrote:protectionwillnotbelost: Glenelg
(Township)
v.
Davis, (1992) CarswellOnt 487 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 13.
The factors that the court should look at in determining whether a partyhas proven legal non-conforming use were outlined in Saint-Romuald
(Ville) v. Olivier, 2001 SCC 57, at para. 39, and paraphrased by this Courtas follows:

A.

a. First characterize the purpose for which the premises were usedprior to the new by-law restrictions. Use is a function of theactivities actually carried on at the site;b. If the current use is merely an intensification of the pre-existingactivity, the protection will not be lost. When the intensificationgoes beyond a matter of degree and constitutes, in terms ofcommunity impact, a difference in kind, the protection may be lost;c. To the extent activities are added, altered or modified within thescope of the original use, the court has to balance the landowner’sinterest against that of the community;d. Neighbourhood effects should not be assumed but must beestablished by evidence;e. The characterization of the acquired right should not be so narrowas to rob the land owner of some flexibility in the reasonableevolution of prior activities;f. The court is to look at the facts objectively, not subjectively withpersonal value judgments, when characterizing the acquired rightand changes to the original purpose.

[45]

In my view, the use to which the property in this case is presently being put goes beyondbeing merely an intensification of the use to which the property was being put prior to thepassage of by-law 2014-45 and constitutes a substantially different use. The auto repairsthat were undertaken by Lafond’s Towing and Recovery were incidental to its towingoperation and not part of the business of an auto repair shop. In contrast, the businessnow being operated at 567 is a dedicated auto repair shop. Among other things, alicensed mechanic is now employed there, the name has been changed to reflect thenature of the business, a lift and other equipment necessary to the repair of motor vehicleshas been added, and invoices are now being regularly issued for repairs to motor vehiclesother than as an adjunct to being towed.

[46]

My conclusion is in conformity with the cases to which I have been referred by counsel.

[47]

In the Paradise decision referred to above, the business at issue was an auto repairbusiness which also sold automotive equipment. Occasionally, it sold used cars. Anissue arose as to whether the property could be used as a used car lot as a legal nonconforming use. Russell J. held that the occasional sale of a used vehicle did notconstitute the business of selling used cars (para. 24)

[48]

In Beresford (Town) v. Brunswick Rent A Car Ltd. (1996), 178 N.B.R. (2d) 233
(Q.B.T.D.), aff’d (1997) N.B.R. (2d) 318 (N.B.C.A.), the municipality sought to enjointhe defendant from operating an automobile graveyard in violation of the municipality’szoning by-law. The defendant was in the business of selling and renting motor vehicles.

The evidence indicated that, prior to the passage of the by-law in question, the defendantkept between 30 and 40 scrapped vehicles behind its property for the purpose ofobtaining spare parts. At the time of the application, the number of vehicles had grown tobetween 200 and 300 and included selling the bodies of vehicles to third parties for profit.
McIntyre J. held that the storage of 20 to 30 vehicles on the premises was incidental tothe business of selling and renting used trucks and cars. For that reason, the court foundthat the defendant was not in the business of operating an automobile graveyard prior tothe passage of the by-law and, therefore, the non-conforming use was illegal.

[49]

In my view, a similar result should be reached in this case.

Has the auto repair shop operated continuously since the enactment of by-law 2014-45?

[50]

Even if Mr. Lafond was operating an auto repair shop at 567 at the time by-law 2014-45
came into force, I would still grant the application. The respondents have failed to provethat any auto repair shop operated at 567 between the date that the towing business wasmoved in November 2015 and February 2016.

[51]

After Lafond’s Towing and Recovery moved to Toulouse Crescent, an inspection of 567
was undertaken by a West Nipissing by-law enforcement officer on November 3, 2015.
That inspection revealed no indication of an auto repair shop operating there on that date.
None of the photos or invoices produced by Mr. Lafond show any auto repair work beingundertaken at 567 between November 2015 and February 2016. The employees that Mr.Lafond indicates were employed by him prior to February 2016 were all employed inconnection with the towing business, according to his evidence. That business wasmoved as of November 2015.

[52]

Mr. Lafond’s affidavits contain no evidence that an auto repair shop operated at 567
during this period of time. In his affidavit sworn November 3, 2016, Mr. Lafonddeposed, at para. 11, as follows:
I carry on auto repairs on this property.

[53]

This is a statement as to what was occurring at the time Mr. Lafond swore his affidavit,not as to what occurred between November 2015 and February 2016.

[54]

In his affidavit sworn January 31, 2017, Mr. Lafond deposed as follows, at paras. 6-8:
I operated a towing business and auto repair shop at 567 DutrisacRoad in the Municipality of West Nipissing since October 2009,provided I did not employ more than two persons on a full timebasis therein. I did not employ more than two employees at 567
Dutrisac Road between October 2009 until July 2014.
I constructed a garage consisting of 5200 square feet at 7 ToulouseCrescent in the Municipality of West Nipissing and relocated thetowing operation to 7 Toulouse Crescent.

[55]

By Mr. Lafond’s own evidence, Mr. Poisson was not hired until February, 2016 (seeNovember 3, 2016, affidavit, at para. 4).

[56]

At para. 14 of his January 31, 2017, affidavit, Mr. Lafond also deposed:
I prepared a list which contains details of auto repairs which I
continued (sic) to perform at 567 Dutrisac Road. Attached heretoas Exhibit “E” is a list containing repairs which predates andpostdated the amended by-law. [Emphasis added.]

[57]

This paragraph does not state that Lafond’s Towing and Recovery continued to performauto repairs at 567 after the business moved to Toulouse Crescent. Rather, all it says isthat it continued to perform auto repairs after July 8, 2014. Most of the items on the listare marked with two asterisks. The list indicates that the repairs marked in this way wereperformed “under Lafond’s towing”. As I have mentioned, Lafond’s towing was movedin or about November 2015. During his cross-examination on February 15, 2017, Mr.Lafond clarified that the items on Exhibit “E” were either completed at Lafond’s towingprior to 2014 on vehicles belonging to Lafond or the business, or performed at Moe’sAuto Repairs from 2016 onward (transcript, p. 65, q. 307 to p. 69, q. 323).

[58]

Finally, during his cross-examination on December 9, 2016, Mr. Lafond confirmed that,although he reached an agreement with Mr. Poisson to operate an auto repair shop at 567
in November 2015, they did not begin to operate the business until February 2016 (p. 64,q. 408 to pa. 65, q. 411).
CONCLUSION

[59]

Based on the evidence to which I have referred, the auto repairs that were undertaken at567 were incidental to the towing business that was operated there until November 2015,when the towing business was moved. Mr. Lafond operated a towing business at 567, notan auto repair shop. Therefore, the previous use of the property was substantiallydifferent than the use to which it is presently being put.

[60]

As well, there is no evidence of any auto repairs being undertaken at 567 between thedate the towing business moved to Toulouse Crescent and the date that Moe’s AutoRepairs began operating in February 2016.

[61]

As a result, the auto repair shop presently operating at 567 is not a legal non-conforminguse.

[62]

For these reasons, the application must be granted.

I kept the auto repair shop at 567 Dutrisac Road and have only oneemployee, namely, Maurice Poisson.
