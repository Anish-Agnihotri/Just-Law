CITATION: Carby-Samuels II v. Carby-Samuels, 2017 ONSC 2911
COURT FILE NO.: 15-66772
DATE: 20170512

RE:

RAYMOND CARBY-SAMUELS II, PlaintiffAND
HORACE R. CARBY-SAMUELS, Defendant

BEFORE:

Mr. Justice Robert N. Beaudoin

HEARD:

By RequisitionENDORSEMENT

[1]

This requisition was referred to me by the Registrar’s Office pursuant to rule 2.1.02 of

the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, following receipt of a written request bythe Plaintiff.

[2]

The Plaintiff seeks the dismissal of the Defendants’ Summary Judgment Motion

scheduled for May 16, 2017, although no copy of the Notice of Motion has been provided. Thefailure to attach a copy of the Notice of Motion is, in and of itself, a sufficient reason to dismissthe request.

[3]

Moreover, the Plaintiff has filed numerous materials, in what appear to be four separate

filings, setting out his arguments in support of his position. There is a copy of the Defendant’sFactum set out in the “Affidavit of Raymond Carby-Samuels on the torts of Horace CarbySamuels.” The Factum reveals that the Defendant seeks an order dismissing the Plaintiff’s claimsin this action and it sets out the extensive history of legal proceedings between these parties.

[4]

The attenuated process for the dismissal of claims or motions set out in Rule 2.1 is not

designed to permit parties to submit written arguments in advance of the hearing of a motion. Ifarguments are necessary to convince the court that it should not grant the relief requested, thosearguments must be made in court, on the return of the motion. The Plaintiff’s attempt to rely on

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO

the attenuated process set out in rule 2.01(2) is clearly inappropriate and this request is

dismissed.
