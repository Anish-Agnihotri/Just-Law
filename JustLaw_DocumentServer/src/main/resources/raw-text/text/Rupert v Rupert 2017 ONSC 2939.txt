DATE: 20170512

3. The motion of the applicant mother, Christine Rupert for interim and

counselling for Sarah.

[2]

On consent, Mr. Rupert’s motion to determine Sarah’s primary residence

had been adjourned on October 21, 2016 pending receipt of an assessment bythe London Family Court Clinic. Ms. Rupert’s motion for spousal support andchild support was also adjourned to be heard after the motion with respect toSarah’s primary residence was determined.

[3]

The report of the London Family Court Clinic dated February 28, 2017

was before the court on April 21, 2017 as an exhibit to Ms. Rupert’s furtheraffidavit sworn on April 13, 2017. Upon reviewing the assessment report, itappeared that Sarah’s views and preferences about what custody and accessarrangements would be appropriate to her had not been addressed. For reasonsgiven in court on April 21, 2017, the motion to determine Sarah’s primaryresidence was adjourned again to enable the London Family Court Clinic toinquire into Sarah’s views and preferences, to the extent those views andpreferences can be reasonably ascertained. The motion was adjourned to nofixed date, returnable on 7 days’ notice after the supplementary report of theLondon Family Court Clinic containing those views and preferences has beenfiled.

retroactive spousal and child support, and for an order to facilitate

[4]

The motion brought by Mr. Rupert for an order seeking the involvement

to determine Sarah’s primary residence is before the court. I remain seized ofboth motions.

[5]

I heard submissions on Ms. Rupert’s motion for support and for an order

to obtain counselling for Sarah over the balance of the time allocated for thethree motions. This is my decision on those issues.
Counselling

[6]

Ms. Rupert seeks an order in her notice of motion dated July 26, 2016

that Mr. Rupert consent to counselling for Sarah.

[7]

Ms. Rupert has deposed in her affidavit dated April 13, 2017 that she has

put her name on the list for parenting programs offered by Keystone Child, Youthand Family Services. Mr. Rupert stated in his affidavit dated April 18, 2017 thatKeystone does not become involved while matters are still before the court. It isfor this reason that he brought his motion to request an order inviting theinvolvement of the Office of the Children’s Lawyer.

[8]

In the course of adjourning the motion seeking the involvement of the

OCL and on hearing submissions on Ms. Rupert’s motion for counselling, it

of the Office of the Children’s Lawyer was adjourned to the next date his motion

appeared to me that neither counsel objected to Keystone as a counselling

both parents to provide the counselling it offers to children, youth and families. I
heard submissions from Mr. Arnold that a finding has never been made that Mr.Rupert objected to counselling. Mr. Arnold indicated that Mr. Rupert would givehis consent to counselling, including counselling services that Keystone wouldprovide, as long as no negative inference could be made that he has withheld hisconsent in the past .

[9]

It is therefore ordered that Bradley Rupert shall consent to enrolling

Sarah for counselling at Keystone Child, Youth and Family Services, and that hecomplete all intake forms there for that counselling. No inference shall be drawnfrom making this order that Mr. Rupert has ever objected to, or improperlywithheld his consent that Sarah receive this counselling.
Child Support

[10]

Sarah is one of two children of the marriage. Her sister, Samantha Anne

Marie Rupert was born on January 21, 2000 (now age 17). Samantha hasresided with her father since the parties separated in 2014 and does not see hermother.

service for Sarah. I heard submissions that Keystone requires the consent of

[11]

Ms. Rupert seeks set off child support for Sarah from Mr. Rupert as

Mr. Rupert. Mr. Rupert would pay set off support to Ms. Rupert because he has ahigher annual income. Mr. Rupert’s income between 2013 and 2015 from hisemployment by Ontario Power Generation at the Bruce Power site has been:
1. 2013 - $147,229, less $1,050 union dues2. 2014 - $138,979, less $1,080 union dues3. 2015 - $131,159, less $1,109 union dues.

[12]

Mr. Rupert was off work in 2015 for several months because of stress.

He was not off work in 2016. Mr. Rupert’s 2016 income was $133,831, less
$1,080 for union dues.

[13]

Ms. Rupert’s income between 2013 and 2015 has been:
1. 2013 - $57,165
2. 2014 - $61,846
3. 2015 - $66,235

[14]

At the motion, the court was informed that Ms. Rupert’s income for 2016

totalled $74,000.

Sarah lives part time with each of them, and Samantha resides exclusively with

[15]

Mr. Rupert has been paying Ms. Rupert interim child support on a

contributing 65% of Sarah’s extraordinary expenses under section 7 of the ChildSupport Guidelines.

[16]

Ms. Rupert proposes that the section 7 expenses for each daughter be

capped at $1,000 a year per child.

[17]

Mr. Rupert provided the decision of the Court of Appeal in Vanos v.

Vanos, 2010 ONCA 876 as authority for the court to base support awards oncurrent annual incomes, rather than on the income of any party for past years. Inparagraph 13 of Vanos, the court explained that:

[13] In our view, where the amount of child support that should have been paidin a prior year is under consideration, the payor’s actual income for that year isthe amount that should be used to calculate support for the prior period, so longas the payor’s actual income for the prior period is known.

[18]

I am therefore of the view that child support for 2016 should be based on

Mr. Rupert’s income for that year of $132,751, net of union dues, and Ms.Rupert’s income of $74,000 which is now known. As Sarah currently spendsgreater than 40% of her time with each parent, the amount Mr. Rupert is to pay inchild support for Sarah each month is subject to set off pursuant to section 9 ofthe Child Support Guidelines. The amount payable for Sarah’s support in turn isset off by the amount that Ms. Rupert shall pay Mr. Rupert for Samantha under

voluntary basis in the amount of $250 a month since 2014. He has also been

the circumstances. The net amount Mr. Rupert is therefore ordered to pay Ms.

was calculated on the 2016 income of each party using DivorceMate software.

[19]

Pursuant to the agreement between the parties, Mr. Rupert and Ms.

Rupert shall contribute 65% and 35% respectively to the extraordinary expensesof each child. Samantha now plays baseball at a relatively advanced level for herage group, and Sarah enjoys riding horses and equestrian related activities. Thepursuits of each child engage extraordinary expenses for that child to enjoy heractivities. Those expenses are capped at a maximum of $1,000 per child for eachof the years 2016, 2017 and, if necessary, 2018, subject to further order.
Spousal Support

[20]

According to the evidence filed on the motion, Ms. Rupert worked for

Community Living in Norfolk County for 18 years. She earned approximately
$43,000 a year before the family moved to Bruce County to benefit Mr. Rupert’scareer.

[21]

Ms. Rupert resumed working as a branch manager for VPI Inc. in

Walkerton, where she has now worked for over 5 years. The income she hasdisclosed since 2013 is in excess of the amount she earned before the movefrom Norfolk County. The evidence on the motion is uncertain about what gap, if

Rupert for child support on a temporary basis is therefore $43 a month, which

any, was caused by the move to Walkerton. No expert evidence was filed about

Ms. Rupert earned before the move to the annual salary she earns now.

[22]

I also find there is no evidence of any discrepancy in the living

environment between the home Ms. Rupert makes with her new life partner onhis farm, and the home Mr. Rupert makes for one or both daughters. Therefore,there is no evidence for me to consider any submission on the need for suppor tto equalize living conditions for Sarah under Contino v. Leonelli-Contino, 2003
[23]

I find there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the spousal

support should be awarded for compensatory reasons, or on the basis of need.
For the same reason, I am not in a position to determine whether spousalsupport should be ordered retroactive to a certain date. The spousal support Ms.Rupert seeks in each respect is better left as an issue for trial.
Conclusion

[24]

The motion of Ms. Rupert is granted to the extent provided by this

endorsement, and a temporary order shall issue that:

any present day value adjustments the court should apply to compare the income

1. Mr. Rupert shall give his consent for Keystone to provide counselling

2. Mr. Rupert shall pay child support on a set off basis for Sarah in theamount of $43 a month;3. The parties shall each maintain both Samantha and Sara on his orher extended health and medical benefit plan for so long as thatchild is eligible for coverage and that coverage is available to him orher through his or her employment;4. Mr. Rupert shall maintain life insurance coverage for Ms. Rupert andfor Sarah for so long as he has an obligation to support Sarah andthat life insurance is available to him through his employment;5. The parties shall pay extraordinary expenses under section 7 of theChild Support Guidelines to a maximum of $1,000 per child eachyear net of fundraising for 2016, 2017 and, if necessary, 2018 basedon contributions of 65% from Mr. Rupert and 35% from Ms. Rupert;and

services to Sarah;

6. The claim of Ms. Rupert for spousal support is dismissed, without

trial.

[25]

The costs of this motion and the attendance to adjourn the other two

motions on April 21, 2017 are reserved to the date I hear the motion for thedetermination of Sarah’s primary residence.
