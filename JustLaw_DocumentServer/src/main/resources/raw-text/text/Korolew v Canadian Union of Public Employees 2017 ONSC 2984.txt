COURT FILE NO.: 17-72455
DATE: 20170515

RE:

LORETTA JEAN KOROLEW, PlaintiffAND
CANADIAN UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, Defendant

BEFORE:

Mr. Justice Robert N. Beaudoin

HEARD:

By RequisitionENDORSEMENT

[1]

This matter has been referred to me by the Registrar following the receipt of a written

requisition from the Defendant seeking the summary dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule2.1.01. It appears that the Plaintiff was copied with that request.

[2]

I have reviewed the Statement of Claim which is extremely brief. The Plaintiff has

adapted form 14A to include the word “DAFAMATION” under the words “STATEMENT OF
CLAIM.”

[3]

The Plaintiff has further inserted the following words at paragraph 6:
IF YOU PAY THE PLANTIFFF’S CLAIM, and $6,000,000……for costs, withinthe time for serving…..”

[4]

The claim itself is limited to one word: “Dafamation.”

[5]

There is no pleading of any material fact in support of the claim advanced and, as such,

the action appears on its face to be frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process.

[6]

I therefore make the following orders:
1. The Registrar is directed to give notice to the Plaintiff in form 2.1A that the Court isconsidering making an order under sub-rule 2.1.01 dismissing the action;

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO

3. The Registrar shall accept no further filings in this action excepting only the Plaintiff’swritten submissions if delivered in accordance with sub-rule 2.1.01(3).

Mr. Justice Robert N. BeaudoinDate: May 15, 2017

2. Pending the outcome of the written hearing under Rule 2.1, or further order of the Court,the Plaintiff’s action is stayed pursuant to section 106 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C.43.
