family home”) as joint tenants.

[4]

The parties resided together in the family home with the children until they separated in

September 2015.

[5]

Since separation, Ms. Kaing and the children have lived in the family home. The family

home has three bedrooms and is 1473 square feet, with an unfinished basement. It is located inthe south ward of the city.

[6]

Mr. Shaw lives in a one bedroom apartment in the north ward of Thunder Bay. He pays

rent of $650.00 per month.

[7]

Ms. Kaing pays the mortgage, taxes and utility costs for the family home. The mortgage

payment is $398.40 per month. Taxes are $191.08 per month.

[8]

In July 2016, the family home was appraised at a market value of $135,000.00. The

principal amount presently outstanding on the mortgage is $87,803.00.

[9]

Mr. Shaw is employed at the Thunder Bay Charity Casino as a part-time slot technician at

an income of $30,000.00 per year. Pursuant to an order of Justice Pierce made on June 29, 2016,Mr. Shaw has been paying to Ms. Kaing child support of $493.00 per month. Under the ChildSupport Guidelines this is reflective of a yearly income of $24,000.00, which Mr. Shaw had beenearning until recently, although the order recites that the $493.00 support is based on a yearlyincome of $30,000.00. Mr. Shaw acknowledges that at his actual present yearly income of

May 2013, in advance of their move, they purchased the home at 837 McMillan Street (“the

[10]

Ms. Kaing is not employed. She attends Confederation College as a full-time student. She

deposes that she will graduate in April 2018 with a 3-year advanced diploma which will qualifyher for a human resources designation. She anticipates that with that designation she will be ableto find at least an entry level position with a salary in the range of $40,000.00 to $60,000.00. Herpresent income is limited to the child support payment of $493.00 per month and a Canada childbenefit payment of $1703.41 per month.

[11]

In addition to the jointly owned home in Thunder Bay, the parties also jointly own a

house in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Ms. Kaing’s parents reside in that house. The rent that theypay to Ms. Kaing covers the mortgage, taxes and utilities for the house. That house has beenappraised at $335,000.00 and has a mortgage in the principal amount of approximately
$211,000.00.

[12]

Mr. Shaw submits that Ms. Kaing has refused to deal in a reasonable manner with the

disposition of the family home and the house in Nanaimo. He states that she is stalling becausethe status quo is beneficial to her and her parents.

[13]

Mr. Shaw submits that because of his modest income, he can only rent a one bedroom

apartment. He submits that this limits his access to the children because the apartment is toosmall for extended visits.

[14]

Mr. Shaw submits that because his equity is tied up in the family home and in the

Nanaimo house, he is unable to rent or buy a home. He produced advertisements for homes in

Shaw’s payments under the June 29, 2016 order are in good standing.

be a third mortgage in his name.

[15]

If an order is granted to compel the sale of the family home, Mr. Shaw’s first preference

would be to purchase Ms. Kaing’s one-half interest. The family home was previously owned byMr. Shaw’s family and he lived in the home for part of his childhood.

[16]

Mr. Shaw is prepared to delay any closing date for the sale of the family home until after

June 30, 2017, to allow the children to finish their school year.

[17]

Mr. Shaw submits that delaying a decision on the sale of the family home until trial

would be prejudicial to him and not in the best interest of the children because he will be unableto obtain appropriate accommodation during that time to allow him to care for the children.

[18]

Counsel for Mr. Shaw estimates that the trial in this matter will be held in either the

coming fall or early winter. A settlement conference was held on November 25, 2016. A furthersettlement conference was ordered to be held by April 30, 2017, although that does not appear tohave happened.

[19]

Ms. Kaing deposes that the children have spent the majority of their lives in the family

home. They have an uncle who lives next door and an aunt who lives one street over. Ms. Kaingdeposes that the uncle and aunt assist her from time to time in the care of the children.

Decision on MotionMr. Justice D.C. Shaw

-5------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[20] Ms. Kaing deposes that she does not have the financial resources to move from the family

beyond her financial ability to pay.

Moreover, some are too small and some would take her

children out of their neighbourhood, away from their relatives, friends, school and daycare.

[21]

Ms. Kaing submits that after she graduates and obtains employment she will be in a

position to bid on the family home, or to purchase Mr. Shaw’s one-half interest, or to find othersuitable accommodation for the children. She submits that to require the house to be sold whileshe is unemployed, in full-time attendance at school and caring for three children amounts tomalicious and oppressive conduct.
Discussion

[22]

Because the parties are not married, the family home is not a matrimonial home within

the meaning of the Family Law Act. The provisions of Part II of the Family Law Act regardingexclusive possession of a matrimonial home are therefore not applicable to the facts of this case.

[23]

Section 2 of the Partition Act provides that all joint tenants may be compelled to sell the

land. Where the property in question is not a matrimonial home, there is a narrow standard forthe exercise of the court’s discretion to refuse the prima facie right of a joint owner to partitionand sale.

[24]

The standard for the exercise of the court’s discretion has been stated by the Ontario

Court of Appeal in Latcham v. Latcham, [2002] O.J. No. 2126 (Ont. C.A.), namely, that to denyan application for sale, the party seeking the sale must be guilty of malicious, vexatious oroppressive conduct.

Decision on MotionMr. Justice D.C. Shaw

-6------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[25] In Greenbanktree Power Corp. v. Coinmatic Canada Inc., [2004] O.J. No. 5158, at para.

of Appeal stated:
Co-tenants should only be deprived of this statutory right in the limitedcircumstances described above, with this caveat. In our view, “oppression” properlyincludes hardship, and a judge can refuse partition and sale because hardship to theco-tenant resisting the application would be of such a nature as to amount tooppression.

[26]
Any allegation of malicious, vexatious, or oppressive conduct should relate to thepartition and sale issue itself. Specifically, it is necessary to look at thereasonableness of the positions taken by the parties as it relates to the application forpartition and sale. Osborne v. Myette, 2004 Carswell Ont. 3331 (S.C.J.) at para. 12.

[27]

In Kaphalakos v. Dayal, 2016 ONSC 3559 (Div. Ct.), the Divisional Court allowed an

appeal from the decision of the motion judge who had granted summary judgment on a motionfor partition and sale. The property was a home owned jointly by two elderly unmarried parties.
The respondent on the appeal had brought a motion under the Partition Act for sale of the home.
The appellant had been attacked in the home with a hammer and was critically injured. Therespondent was charged with a number of criminal offences, including attempted murder.

[28]

The Divisional Court reviewed and agreed with the principles set out above in Latcham

and in Akman. The Divisional Court held that because the respondent was a co-owner of theproperty, the respondent’ s motion for sale could not be described as vexatious.

[29]

That left the issue of whether the respondent’s motion for an order for sale was

oppressive.

1, the Court of Appeal confirmed that Latcham set out the appropriate test. At para. 2, the Court

Kaing v. ShawCourt File No:FS-16-0057

Decision on MotionMr. Justice D.C. Shaw

-7------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[30]
The Divisional Court reviewed and adopted the statement of the Court of Appeal in

30:
The “oppression inquiry” was described by Emery J. in Morris v. Donegan, 2015
ONSC 3360, 11 E.T.R. (4th ) 88, at para. 138, “I am of the view that this factorrequires the court consider any evidence on the effect of the sale…. to determine ifthe combined cause-and-effect of the sale amounts to oppression.”

[31]

The Divisional Court in Kaphalakos held that the motion judge was in error in finding

that if she accepted the applicant’s affidavit those facts were not capable of supporting aconclusion that the bringing of the motion for sale was oppressive. At para. 39, the DivisionalCourt held:
Bringing the motion results in the sale of the property and the sale of the propertydeprives the appellant of a place to live at a time when, if you accept her affidavit,she is physically and mentally impaired and has no place to live. Such a result iscapable of supporting a finding that the bringing of the motion is oppressive: see forexample Klakow v. Klakow (1972), 7 R.F.L. 349 (Ont. S.C.).

[32]

Greenbanktree concerned five commercial properties in which the co-tenant applying for

sale under the Partition Act had a minority interest. The Court of Appeal observed that theproperties were commercial properties, owned by sophisticated commercial parties. The Court ofAppeal found that the test set out in Latcham as to the scope of discretion under the Partition Actwas the appropriate one, “particularly in a commercial context.” The Court of Appeal went on tosay:
The Act gives tenants in common a prima facie right to compel partition or sale. A
narrow interpretation of the discretion makes commercial sense by enhancingpredictability.

Greenbanktree that oppression properly includes hardship. The Divisional Court stated, at para.

Kaing v. ShawCourt File No:FS-16-0057

Decision on MotionMr. Justice D.C. Shaw

-8------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[33]
The property in question in the instant case is not a commercial property. It is a family

narrow view of the scope of discretion as to what constitutes hardship.

[34]

This family home is the residence of three young children and the parent who is their

primary caregiver.

In my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this particular case to

consider hardship not just to the joint tenant resisting the application but also to the threechildren in her care who will be directly, and in my view, adversely affected by a forced sale atthis time. The sale of the family home will deprive the children of a place to live at a time whenMs. Kaing has no means to obtain reasonable alternative accommodation. The mortgage andtaxes payable on the family home are under $600.00 per month. This is considerably less thanthe rent for the rental homes that Mr. Shaw lists as comparable. Ms. Kaing’s income is limited tochild support and Canada child benefits. Mr. Shaw deposes that at his income, which is presently
$30,000.00 per year, he is unable to obtain an apartment or home larger than the one bedroomapartment in which he presently resides. Mr. Shaw’s income is greater than Ms. Kaing’s. It is notclear whether Mr. Shaw is suggesting that Ms. Kaing should be required to use her share of theequity in the family home to pay rent for alternative accommodation. If this is his suggestion, I
do not accept that pending trial Ms. Kaing should be required to spend her limited capital on arental residence for her and the children.

[35]

Mr. Shaw submits that with her one-half share of the equity on the family home, which

after the costs of sale would be about $20,000.00, Ms. Kaing could buy another homecomparable to the family home. In my view, it is reasonable to assume that Ms. Kaing would not

[36]

In summary, a sale of the family home at this time would be disruptive to the lives of the

children, uprooting them from their neighbourhood, their uncle and aunt, their friends, theirschool and their daycare, with no evidence that Ms. Kaing would be able to obtain reasonablealternative accommodation. It would be incompatible with their best interests.

[37]

In my opinion, this would amount to hardship sufficient to find that the bringing of the

motion for sale is oppressive. It warrants that I exercise my discretion to dismiss the motion.
Conclusion

[38]

For the reasons given, Mr. Shaw’s summary judgment motion for sale of the home

located at 837 McMillan Street, Thunder Bay is dismissed.
Costs

[39]

At the conclusion of the hearing of the motion, counsel agreed that regardless of whether

the motion was granted or dismissed, there should be no order of costs. Accordingly, no costs ofthis motion are ordered.
