Joao Rocha Lima, RespondentBEFORE:

The Honourable Mr. Justice R.D. Reilly

COUNSEL: Lawrence K. Greaves, Counsel for the ApplicantMark S. Grossman / Samantha Ahn, Counsel for the RespondentRULING ON COSTS

[1]

I have now had the opportunity to read written submissions regarding costs. I conclude

both parties acted in good faith and had merit in their respective positions. They were both wellrepresented by experienced counsel.

It could not be said that either the applicant or the

respondent suffered an unexpected prejudice as a result of the ruling of the court. Both partiesare now able to get on with their lives and plan for the future, without any interference from ordependence upon the other party.

[2]

Therefore, in all the circumstances, I direct that each party shall bear their own costs of

the application.

[3]

I thank counsel for their assistance on the application.
