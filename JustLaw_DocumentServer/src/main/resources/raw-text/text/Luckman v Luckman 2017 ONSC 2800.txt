Brent’s Income

[11]

Since the party’s separation in 2008, determining Brent’s income has been problematic.

He has consistently stated that he is working on projects that will generate income but has noincome to pay support.

[12]

Brent has had a history of working as an entrepreneur. He does not have a university

degree or college diploma but has been working since the age of 19. He has worked as a retailsales clerk, store manager, industrial commercial sales person, regional sales manager in Ottawa,worked in Dallas, Texas as the head distributor of Canadian sales for Texas instruments, he hasbeen the manufacturer’s representative for Toshiba Canada to name a few.

[13]

From 1989 to 2008, he has founded a series of companies in the technology field. In

2008, he and Roland Deschamps founded Maxa Fuel Saver Inc. (“Maxa”). In 2010, he foundedDDCI, a Delaware company that sold HP products. He received commissions until the thirdquarter of 2011 when he ceased employment.

Kershman dated August 23, 2012 be dismissed with costs;

[14]

In July 2012, he obtained employment with Ontario Environmental Solutions (“OES”)

that lasted six weeks. In 2013, he travelled to the Ukraine to pursue business opportunities for

development for over the top television. He did some work in 2015 for the company until May2015.

[15]

In January 2016, he was involved in the formation of a Los Angeles-based technology

company who was going to enter the on demand liquor delivery service in the United States withincorporation to occur in November 2016.

[16]

In June 2016, he co-founded Totem Liquors and negotiated to be the exclusive agent for

the sale of spirits and wines from Rebel Spirits, located in Los Angeles, California, for theCanadian market.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AS BASIS FOR THE FINAL ORDER

[17]

Prior to the final agreement of 2012, Lanita believed that Brent had other sources of

income. Brent’s actions do not support the declared income on his income tax returns. Forexample:
(a)

Brent consistently claimed that he had no income, but he was developingbusinesses and income was imminent. In his affidavit dated January 9, 2012, Brentmade the following statements:
11(O). Finally, I admit I am still in arrears of child support, assubstantial business payments I have been expecting for months havenot yet transpired. It is my hope there will be a significant change inthe situation in the coming month, but I cannot be assured. In anyevent, I am advised by my solicitor that the failure to pay a monetaryamount cannot be the subject matter of a contempt motion.

(b)

Brent was driving a Lexus motor vehicle and in 2011 a Bentley motor vehicle;

(c)

On May 24, 2012, Brent signed a promissory note as the director of 1605798
Ontario Inc. promising to pay Ginette Grandmont the sum of $138,000 plus

Maxa. In 2014, he and another individual started a company to work on research and

interest of 5% per annum over the next three years. Brent paid $38,000 to theFamily Responsibility Office and $30,000 to three separate credit cards;On May 24, 2012, Brent paid the sum of $38,000 from a Bank of Montréal account3219 1002-135 in the name of 1605798 Ontario Inc. as outstanding child supportand requested that his passport and driver’s license be reinstated;
(e)

From June 1 to September 3, 2012, Brent paid $13,160 for his fiancée’s apartmentin Vancouver while he lived in Ottawa; and,

(f)

In early August, 2012, Brent exchanged emails with Premier Funding USA andClearview Leasing making inquiries about his interest in acquiring a 2012 BentleyContinental GT motor vehicle for $179,500. At that time, Brent was in arrears ofchild support.

[18]

When the parties settled the matter in August 2012, Lanita was aware that in the period of

November 2010 to August 2011, Brent received over $100,000 in commissions. At thesettlement conference in August 2012, Brent disclosed that he had obtained a position with OES
as of July 30, 2012 as vice president of business development with an annual income of $82,000.

[19]

Based on that disclosure, Lanita agreed that Brent would pay child support for the two

children based on his income of $82,000. Based on that agreement, the Court set the amount ofmonthly child support for two children based on the income of $82,000 at $1184 per month.

[20]

Lanita was employed earning $95,000 and both children were residing in Ottawa with

Lanita but moving to Regina, Saskatchewan for work.
CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DIVORCE ORDER

[21]

Following the divorce order, Lanita moved to Regina and moved back to Ottawa in May

2013. She is employed with an annual income of $95,000.

[22]

Brent worked for the OES for four weeks but stopped when he had not been paid a salary

and did not receive the signing bonus. He says he realized that the owner of the company was not

(d)

in the position to pay him. Consequently, Brent went back to developing the automotive fuelsaver for gasoline and diesel motors for Maxa.
Brent decided to pursue the development of Maxa on a full-time basis. He travelled to the

Ukraine starting on January 4, 2013 to investigate the opportunities for low-cost manufacturingof his product in the Ukraine. However, Brent’s efforts were unsuccessful.

[24]

On March 28, 2013, Brent married his wife, Olena in the Ukraine who had her own

company which produced and sold energy bracelets in the Ukraine.

[25]

While in the Ukraine, Brent became ill and was diagnosed with a ventral hernia and was

operated on May 7, 2013. He was discharged on May 22, 2013. After being discharged, Brent’shealth situation worsened and he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis which requiredmedication. He was advised to reduce his activities for an 8 to 10 week period. In June 2013, hewas also diagnosed with gallstones and a bacterial infection. Brent admits that in the summer of2013, he assisted his wife in her business selling energy bracelets. He also resumed work withMaxa.

[26]

By August 2013, Brent returned to Canada to see his children. He stayed for

approximately one month and returned back to the Ukraine in September 2013.

[27]

In December 2013, Brent returned to Canada and was hoping to return to the Ukraine in

January 2014. Brent could not return to the Ukraine because of the political situation.

[28]

On March 27, 2014, Brent was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, water on his lungs and

congestive heart failure. He was treated with the medication as well as monitoring his heart andblood pressure. Brent stated that he also was diagnosed with sleep apnea, had persistent problemswith arrhythmia and by the fall of 2014, he was waiting for an appointment with the heartInstitute arrhythmia specialist.

[29]

During this time, Brent focused on Maxa. One of his customers, KLT Innovations LLC,

placed a large order. Brent tried to sell Maxa to KLT but that transaction fell through in lateNovember\early December 2014.

[23]

[30]

Throughout 2015, Brent stated that he had various health conditions relating to his heart

that affected his ability to breathe, to stand, to do groceries and to walk without difficulty. By

indicating that Brent had been under his care since 2007 and specifically stated:
He suffered a deep vein thrombosis in his left leg complicated by pneumonia. Hehas also developed atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and severe sleepapnea which has greatly affected his function and quality of life. A nuclearcardiac test showed that Mr. Luckman has an ejection fraction of 30%. Normalheart function is over 60%. Mr. Luckman has undergone a failed attempt atcardioversion in an effort to improve his heart function. He must take severalmedications which impair his ability to function normally including bloodthinners and beta blocker. He has not been able to work or exercise as a result.
These medications are known to cause fatigue, poor concentration and can effecthigher cognitive functions. He is currently seeing multiple specialists to aid in hismedical conditions. Due to his present condition, additional stress such as courtproceedings should be avoided for a period of 90 days. He will complete furthercardiac test and meet with his cardiologist during that period to assessmedications and review new treatment options.

[31]

In a follow- up letter dated March 31, 2015, Dr. Mankal, stated:
Mr. Luckman suffers from atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Thesehave been stabilized by medication and he is under the care of a cardiologist.
Although he should avoid stressful situations such as court proceedings andbusiness dealings, there is no reason to avoid driving or interaction with hischildren at this time. His medications do not affect his ability to supervisechildren and he does not pose a risk to them.

[32]

In April 2015, Brent became aware that there was a procedure that was being performed

by Dr. Narayan, in California that was not available in Canada that could assist Brent. Brentforwarded his medical information to this doctor who was prepared to perform the procedure athis office in the Stanford, California. By letter dated May 13, 2015 and June 16, 2015, Dr.Narayan stated that Brent needed to be excused from work duties, court hearings or strenuousphysical activities as part of the recovery process and the procedure.

[33]

On June 8, 2015, the doctor performed the procedure on Brent and on June 20, 2015,

Brent returned to Ottawa. By July 2015, he was able to walk without having to stop or fight to

letter dated March 18, 2015, Dr. Mankal, a family doctor in Ottawa provided correspondence

breathe. For the rest of 2015, Brent was recovering from his health related issues. By November2015, the doctor confirmed that the procedure was a success.
In February 2016, Brent travelled to California to have a meeting with Dr. Narayan. At

that time, he was hospitalized for five days a result of having severe abdominal cramps andvomiting. During his hospital stay, Brent had his stomach pumped numerous times andunderwent a series of tests and x-rays. The doctors diagnosed that he had an abdominal adhesionor kink in his intestines related to accidentally ingesting glass in 1993. The doctors are reluctantto operate as further abdominal surgery may lead to more abdominal adhesions. Brent wasreleased with recommendation to eat a low to medium residue diet to avoid future blockages inhis intestines.

[35]

By March 2016, Brent was off beta-blockers and his breath was back but he had to go

back on beta blockers in May 2016. Over the course of the summer, Brent monitored his bloodpressure. In September 2016, he went to the emergency department. His heart rate was 227\145.
He was discharged after and went to see Dr. Mankal.

[36]

By letter dated October 6, 2016, Dr. Mankal indicated :
“his medical history is positive for atrial fibrillation for which he was treatedsurgically in June 2015…….. He no longer takes any medication for this problem.
Mr. Luckman is being treated for hypertension with Cozaar 25 MG daily……
He’s also being treated for obstructive sleep apnea with cpap therapy. He takes noother medication and is not dealing with any other active issues at this time.

CHILD SUPPORT
The Legislative Framework and Jurisprudence

[38]

Section 17(1)(a) of the Divorce Act, 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) provides that a court of

competent jurisdiction may make an order varying, rescinding or suspending, prospectively orretroactively a support order or any provision thereof on application by either or both formerspouses.

[39]

Section 17 (4) provides that before the court makes a variation order in respect of a child

support order, the court shall satisfy itself that the change of circumstances as provided for in theapplicable guidelines has occurred since the making of the child support order or the lastvariation order made in respect of that order.

[40]

Section 17(4.1) provides that before the court makes a variation order in respect of a

spousal support order, the court shall satisfy itself that a change in the condition, means, needs orother circumstances of either former spouse has occurred since the making of the spousal supportorder or the last variation order made in respect of that order, and, in making the variation order,the court shall take that change into consideration.

[41]

The term “material change” is a change such that if known at the time, would likely have

resulted in a different term in the order. The change must not have been known at the relevant

payments of approximately $6500/month for part of the year and that Maxa had

time and the burden is on the moving party to prove on a balance of probabilities that the changerelied upon meets this definition. (Willick v Willick 1994, S.C.J. No 94 SCC).
Before the court can embark upon an inquiry, the moving party must meet the threshold

under section 17 (Willick, supra).

[43]

The change must not be temporary but must have a degree of continuity (Marinangeli v

Marinangeli, 2000 and O.J. No. 2819. ONCA).

[44]

Once the threshold of section 17 has been met and the court finds that there has been a

material change in circumstance, the court is to determine what variation is applicable in light ofthe change in circumstances (P. v S. 2011 S.C.J. No. 64 SCC).

[45]

Section 19 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, S.O.R./97-175, as am.

[“Guidelines”] states as follows :
19. Imputing income.—(1) The court may impute such amount of income to aparent or spouse as it considers appropriate in the circumstances, whichcircumstances include:
(a) the parent or spouse is intentionally under-employed or unemployed, otherthan where the under-employment or unemployment is required by theneeds of any child or by the reasonable educational or health needs of theparent or spouse;

[46]

There is a three-part test for determining whether income should be imputed on the basis

of intentional under-employment or unemployment as follows:
1.

Is the spouse intentionally under-employed or unemployed?

2.

If so, is the intentional under-employment or unemployment required by virtue of hisreasonable educational needs?

3.

If the answer to question #2 is negative, what income is appropriately imputed in thecircumstances? (Drygala v. Pauli (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 771 (C.A.)

[47]

The following factors are to be considered:

[42]

(a)

A spouse is intentionally under-employed if he or she chooses to earn less than heor she is capable of earning having regard to all of the circumstances (Drygala, at

(b)

There is no requirement that the under-employment or unemployment beundertaken in bad faith or with the intention of avoiding support payments
(Drygala, at paras. 29-36);

(c)

The onus is on the party seeking to impute income to establish an evidentiary basisthat the other party is intentionally under-employed or unemployed (Homsi v.
Zaya, 2009 ONCA 322, 65 R.F.L. (6th) 17, at para. 28);

(d)

There is a duty on the spouse to “actively seek out reasonable employmentopportunities that will maximize their income potential so as to meet the needs oftheir children” (Thompson v. Thompson, 2014 ONSC 5500, at para. 99);

(e)

A spouse’s capacity to earn income can be influenced by his or her age, education,health, work history, and the availability of work that is within the scope of his orher capabilities (Marquez v. Zaipola, 2013 BCCA 433, 344 B.C.A.C. 133, at para.
37);

(f)

Once intentional underemployment is established, the onus shifts to how one of theexceptions of reasonableness (Jackson v. Mayerle, 2016 ONSC 72);

(g)

Where

the

spouse

is

intentionally

and

unreasonably

under-employed

or

unemployed, the court has a large range of discretion to impute as income anamount founded on a rational basis (D.D. v. H.D., 2015 ONCA 409, 335 O.A.C.
376); and
(h)

The main factors a court should consider are the age, education, skills, and healthof the spouse, along with the number of hours that can be worked in light ofcompeting obligations and the hourly rate the spouse could reasonably obtain
(Drygala, supra).

para. 28);

Has there been a material change in circumstances?

[48]

Brent argues that he suffered a material change in circumstances in the fall 2012 and that

of support should be rescinded to equate to his actual income earned in those years.

[49]

Brent admitted that the company that he had DDCI, a US-based company, was closed to

avoid the court imputing an income to him. Brent produced a letter dated September 11, 2011
that indicates Brent and DDCI received commission income from CentricsIT and that Lanitacalculates generated income of approximately $104,662.20 in 2011.

[50]

On July 9, 2012, Brent sent an email to his lawyer in Chicago, Illinois to close down his

Delaware company where he stated as follows:
Hi Michael,Yes I need to close a company that it is causing me grief in my divorce settlement asopposing counsel in Canada always makes it appear like I have a huge income in theirattempt to have the judge impute one whereby I have ridiculous support payments. So itappears best to close the issue and shut it down.
Brent

[51]

In email exchanges between Brent and his then Ontario counsel, Brent stated on June 24,

2012 by email at 4:59 p.m. the following:
Hi Jeremy,I hope you are enjoying your vacation.
One of the issues that was raised by my ex and counsel was this section 7 daycarecosts. This was the first I had ever heard of it on Thursday.
I need to take this into account going forward. I now know it is tax-deductiblehowever child support is not.
I wish someone in 4 years could have explained everything to me from the outsetas it makes it all more palatable.

he has not been able to earn the $82,000 that was the basis of the Divorce Order, that his arrears

They will provide an offer within 2 weeks. Let’s see.

[52]

On June 27, 2012, then counsel for Brent responded as follows:
If you could confirm that it would be awesome. I am hoping the salary will bemore than $50 K or it might raise some suspicion. Keep in mind that if we don’tsettle it is extremely unlikely that I can lower child support prior to the trial inabout a year……
They did end up signing the custody and access agreement. That’s good.

[53]

As the settlement conference was approaching, on August 2, 2012, at 9:18 p.m., Brent

emailed Mark Green, a friend and business associate in the past, and stated as follows:
Hi Mark,Can you make any comments to the pseudo-job I am taking at least for twomonths in order to get out of my existing imputed support order by the court tomy ex which is over 2.5 years old and is totally un-supported.
ThanksBrent

[54]

That same day, at 11 p.m., Mr. J-F Soulard, CFO of OES emailed Brent and stated:
I suggest we make your compensation bi-monthly, a common practice. Ask Markif 6 weeks is too much. Tell me what date you want this offer signed not (sic)
make it look like you just got it before your court date but after your probation isover!
Change what you need and send it back to me.
J-F

[55]

On August 2, 2012, Brent replied by email to Mr. J-F Soulard and said:
Okay change to bi-monthly, 4 weeks, offer dated July 30 2012 and start date leaveas is. Make the changes from your end.

It looks like I am going to take the consulting gig for a year. It has some extensivetravel however they will cover all costs including flying my home to see my kidsif it is in the US or Europe. There may be an upside if I can raise them funding orfind a strategic partner to acquire them.

[56]

On August 3, 2012, Mr. J-F Soulard replied by email:

[57]

Brent produced a two-page employment contract between OES and himself. The

agreement was signed by OES by Mr. Soulard on July 30, 2012 and by Brent on August 3, 2012.
The agreement confirmed that Brent had been hired as Vice President of business developmentand that he would be paid a signing bonus of $10,000, a car allowance of $500 per month andbiweekly payments of base salary of $66,000 for a total income of $82,000. Brent’s evidence isthat within a month he had not been paid, had not received a bonus and there was no possibilitythat he would be paid. He consequently stopped working for the company. He was never paidany salary or bonus.

[58]

As a result of that letter from OES, the parties settled child support reducing the amount

from $2200 per month to $1184 per month. Both Lanita and the court relied upon that evidenceto determine the proper amount of table child support.

[59]

Once Brent started to work for OES, when he indicated he was not being paid a bonus or

a salary, on September 7, 2012, Brent signed a letter as president of Maxa confirming the JeanFrancois Soulard was part owner of 1605798 Ontario Inc. following an investment made of
$138,000 on May 24, 2012. In his testimony, Brent indicated that the letter was signed but thetransfer was never effected. Brent’s testimony is that the funds were dispensed to other partiesbut that $68,000 was used to pay personal expenses.

[60]

Despite alleging that he had no income from OES, on September 13, 2012, Brent sought

information about the cost of cosmetic surgery fee regarding liposuction of his flanks with anestimated cost of $4633 and a second procedure of Upper Blepharoplasty with an estimated costof $2768.50.

[61]

Again, while alleging he had no income, on October 15, 2012, Brent sent a letter of

instructions for redemption to the HSHC Bank, directing that upon maturity, to deposit thenonredeemable GIC in the amount of €1 million to the account of Michael Gold Hill\Gold HillAssociates.

Changes are made. The company is registered: 1531415 Ontario Inc., should I
state that in the letter?

[62]

Brent stated that he was able to survive based on a series of loan including loans from

three individuals totalling approximately $120,000 being Mr. Green, his sister Tanis Luckman

paid for rental cars since returning to Ottawa in 2014 and that he also has an $800 monthallowance towards his vehicle from Totem Liquors. Finally he indicates that his wife is workingand earned $37,000 net since January 2015.
Brent’s Lifestyle

[63]

Brent admitted in cross-examination that over the last eight or nine years he is spent over

$150,000 in legal fees for civil, family and criminal proceedings.

[64]

In 2011, Brent was paying $2,582 per month for lease payments for a motor vehicle.

[65]

From January to April 2014, Maxa paid the rent of a condo that Brent lived in with a

monthly cost of $1,260 per month. In May 2014 until May 2015, Brent rented a two storey, fourbedroom, single-family home across from a golf course in the Stonebridge area of Ottawa with amonthly rent of $2195 per month.

[66]

Brent’s purchased $6,000 in household goods between his financial statement sworn on

November 3, 2014 and his most recent financial statement sworn October 27, 2016 withoutexplanation.

[67]

When Brent came to Ottawa in August 2013 to have summer access with his children, he

spent $29,313.10 in a 10 day period according to his Toronto Dominion Bank statements foraccount number 646-7646.

[68]

In 2014, Brent was not working but he paid rent of $26,340 a year and $12,550 towards

child support. In the months of June and July of 2014, Brent spent $39,950.60 from two accountswith the Toronto Dominion Bank in the name of Maxa and he transferred a further sum of
$37,154.68 to another unknown bank account. Brent testified that it was not all his own expensesbut provided insufficient evidence to support that contention.

and a friend Ms. Mott. Brent further testified that his sister, Ms. Mott and his wife Olena have all

[69]

Since July 2015, Brent is residing in a residence in Gatineau, Québec owned by a friend

where he does not pay a monthly rent but is responsible for Hydro and the snow removal cost of

Analysis

[70]

I find that Brent has embarked upon a course of conduct to convince the court that he has

little or no income. I find that Brent has consistently signed agreements and breached theagreements at a later date as follows:
(a)

failed to pay the child support order of $2000 per month as ordered by JusticeKealey on April 9, 2010 (Brent did not appeal this decision);

(b)

failed to pay table child support of $16,000 representing the child support fromApril 2010 to November 2010 and failed to pay the ongoing child support of
$2000 per month as of June 1, 2011 as ordered by Justice Robertson on March 25,2011;

(c)

failed to pay the table child support of $1184 commencing August 1, 2012 asordered by Justice Kershman on August 23, 2012, which was based on minutes ofsettlement signed by the parties;

(d)

failed to pay the sum of $22,000 on or before March 27, 2013 representing hisshare of section 7 expenses as ordered by Justice Kershman on August 23, 2012
which was based on minutes of settlement signed by the parties;

(e)

failed to pay $4250 per month negotiated with the family responsibility officetowards his child support arrears, ongoing child support and interest other thanthree payments in May, June and July 2014;

(f)

defaulted on his credit payments in his consumer proposal in November andDecember 2012 and January 2013;

$600 per year. He anticipates living in the property until the spring 2017.

(g)

failed to provide proof of the life insurance to secure child support as ordered byJustice Kershman on August 23, 2012 which was based on minutes of settlement

(h)

failed to provide proof that he added the children to any benefit plan as ordered byJustice Kershman on August 23, 2012, which was based on minutes of settlementsigned by the parties.

[71]

On February 17, 2012, the Honourable Justice Kershman found that Brent was in

contempt of court in finding that Brent had deliberately and wilfully misled both Lanita andJustice Robertson on March 25, 2011 that he owned a property that he agreed to pledge assecurity for the payment of support when he, in fact, did not own the property. On March 25,2011 Brent’s signed minutes of settlement that formed the basis of a temporary order of JusticeRobertson, that included, that he make two payments of $8000, with the first due on April 15,2011 and the second on May 12, 2011 representing arrears of child support from April throughNovember 2010; he agreed to pay $2000 per month as of June 1, 2011 as ongoing child supportand agreed to secure his child support payments against land owned in Pontiac, Québec whichwould become enforceable if the payments were not made by June 1, 2011. The payments werenot made. Lanita could not move against the land because it came to light that Brent had sold theproperty in December 26, 2009, 16 months before the consent order of Justice Robertson.

[72]

On April 18, 2012, Justice Kershman ordered that Brent pay costs of $7500 by May 18,

2012 or his pleadings would be struck, ordered Brent to provide the balance of the outstandingdisclosure within the next 50 days, failing which, a motion could be brought to strike hispleadings and ordered that Brent deposit his Canadian passport and permanent resident card withthe court. Further, Justice Kershman imprisoned Brent for contempt of court from April 18, 2012
until April 23, 2012 and that he pay the costs of the contempt motion fixed at $5500 inclusive ofdisbursements and HST within 30 days of the order.

[73]

Regarding the OES employment contract, I find that the agreement was a fiction to create

a paper trail to allow Brent to reduce his monthly child support from $2200 per month to $1184
per month based on an income of $82,000. I note that in the contract that was signed by Mr.

signed by the parties; and

Soulard on July 30, 2012 but the email evidence indicates that on August 2 and 3, 2012, Brentand Mr. Soulard exchanged emails determining the specific terms of the agreement and agreed

[74]

Further, upon a review of the emails exchanged between Brent and his legal counsel in

Canada and United States, he was very well aware that the issue of imputation of income neededto be addressed. I find that Brent enlisted the assistance of business associates to create the offerdated July 30, 2012 to provide Brent with proof of an income to allow him to reduce the monthlyamount of table child support.

[75]

I find that Brent is not a credible witness. For example:
(a)

Brent testified that when he made a proposal in bankruptcy in May 2012, theproposal was rejected by his creditors. However, the proposal failed because Brentfailed to make the required payments;

(b)

As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Brent signed an affidavit dated May 4,2012 where he confirmed that he had no credit or debit cards. However, on May 3,2012 Brent opened an account with the Bank of Montréal account number 8994704 and account number 3995-409 which provided him with the debit card;

(c)

Brent testified that he did not know the CEO of OES, was Mr. Boyd. However inhis affidavit dated October 14, 2016, at paragraph 29, Brent stated that he met withthe CEO. When confronted with this inconsistency, Brent stated that heremembered that he actually spoke to the CEO on the phone;

(d)

In the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Brent stated that his total income earnedwas $28,820 because he says tax losses were offset against income to reduce hisincome to that amount. Brent did not provide any corroborating evidence tosupport such a contention;

(e)

Brent’s evidence was that he paid his expenses based on loans from businesspartners, family and friends. Brent’s produced a schedule of promissory notes

that the offer date of the contract would be July 30, 2012.

indicating that he, Maxa and 2449984 Ontario borrowed approximately $241,000
from friends and family and then since July 2015, he has borrowed an additional

documentation relied on by Brent have been prepared by Brent. The promissoryNotes are signed by Brent. There is no witness and there is no corroborativeevidence from his sister and Ms. Mott confirming said loans. Mr. Green has passedaway and consequently, he cannot provide corroboration. However, Ms. Mottsigned a letter dated October 11, 2016 that was relied upon by Brent concerningher dealings with JF Soulard. Despite Lanita questioning the veracity of the loans,neither Ms. Mott nor Ms. Luckman, Brent’s sister, filed an affidavit corroboratingtheir financial efforts to assist Brent. Considering my finding that Brent is not acredible witness, I reject Brent’s evidence that he is been subsisting on loans fromfamily and friends. His evidence is simply not credible;
(f)

Brent disclosed four different sources of income in 2014. Firstly, the letter fromArt Bowles indicates he received dividends totalling $32,000. Then, his financialstatement dated November 3, 2014 discloses an annual income of $52,000.
Thirdly, Brent was paid a salary from Maxa that do not appear on the financialstatements of Maxa and fourthly, in his affidavit dated October 14, 2016, he statesthat he had no income.

[76]

The jurisprudence directs the court that in determining an imputed income, the court is to

use a rational basis based on the evidence presented to the court. In these circumstances, it isvery difficult to determine Brent’s actual income. However, Brent was prepared to hold out tothe court that he was able to earn $82,000 as income when he settled the matter in 2012.

[77]

I find that Brent has been able to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle without an

apparent commensurate income, that he has lied to the court in the past, has been found incontempt of court for such lies and that he continues to do so in this proceeding.

[78]

Lanita and Justice Kershman relied on that information to base the calculation of table

child support. I find that I cannot rely on his information regarding his income. In the

approximately $120,000 from his sister, Mr. Greene and Ms. Mott. All the

circumstances, I find it is fair, reasonable and rational to impute the income selected by Brent todetermine his child support in 2012 being the sum of $82,000 per year.
Having done so, I also find that there has been no material change in circumstances of

Brent’s financial situation except in the year 2015 which I will canvass later in this decision.
Year 2012

[80]

Brent submits that his income in 2012 was $46,000 despite his income tax return

indicating at line 150 an annual income of $12,600. I reject such submission and will impute anincome of $82,000 to Brent for the reasons set out herein.

[81]

Brent further submits that in the Divorce Order of Justice Kershman, there were two

penalty clauses whereby if Brent did not pay $10,000 of section 7 expenses by September 27,2012 the amount was increased to $20,000. In addition, if Brent did not pay a further sum of
$12,000 on account of section 7 expenses by March 27, 2013 the amount was increased to
$24,000. Brent has submitted that the penalty provisions should be eliminated because thechildren will not suffer any prejudice because those were not actually additional section 7
expenses but were penalties in the event of noncompliance. I disagree. The order was made withBrent’s consent based on his past history of not abiding by court orders. Brent has not providedany evidence that he did not consent. Despite agreeing to these clauses and not paying them,Brent now seeks to avoid the payments. In the circumstances, I reject that request.
Year 2013

[82]

Brent submits that in 2013 he had no income. Upon a review of the evidence, Brent went

to the Ukraine in January 4, 2013. He married his wife Olena on March 28, 2013. He indicates hebecame ill and that he was operated on May 7, 2013 after being diagnosed with a ventral hernia.
He was discharged from the hospital May 22, 2013. Brent indicates that his situation worsenedand he was advised to reduce his activities for an 8 to 10 week period.

[83]

Lanita submits that Brent actually went to the Ukraine as a “medical tourist “to have

performed the medical procedures that he inquired about in September 2012 at a much reduced

[79]

cost in the Ukraine. While I have concerns, the evidence does not convince me on a balance ofprobabilities that Brent had cosmetic surgery done in the Ukraine.
Brent returned to Canada in August 2013 because his visa expired, to explore business

opportunities, to see his children, to see friends and family and to take care of tax issues. Hestayed for a month and returned to the Ukraine in September 2013. He returned to Canada inDecember 2013.

[85]

Having found that Brent is not credible, I do not believe Brent’s evidence that he could

not work for 8 to a 10 week period after his hernia surgery. Consequently, for the year 2013, I donot accept that the hernia surgery and assorted medical difficulties were a material change incircumstance sufficient in nature as to permit a variation of his imputed annual income of
$82,000.

[86]

As of January 2013, the table amount of child support for two children based on an

income of $82,000 from $1,184 per month to $1,198 per month based on changes to the FederalChild Support Guidelines, S.O.R./97-175, as amended.
Year 2014

[87]

Brent testified that he was employed full-time with Maxa receiving a dividend of $6500

per month which was confirmed by a letter for Mr. Art Bowles. Brent testified that he received
$32,500 for the period of May through October 2014. However, Brent submitted that in 2014 hisincome should be determined to be $52,000 based on the dividends he received from Maxa eventhough his tax return indicated no income because apparently his income was offset byshareholder loans. There was no evidence, other than from Brent, corroborating this statementconcerning the shareholder loans. Despite Brent’s statement, he asks the court to impute anincome of $52,000.

[88]

In 2014, Brent testified that he was ill in January, February and March and on March 27,

2014 was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, water in his lungs and congestive heart failure. Hewas treated with medication as well as monitoring his heart and blood pressure. He was nothospitalized and produced no evidence to indicate that he was unable to work.

[84]

[89]

During this period of time he indicated that one of his customers placed a large order and

that he tried to sell his company to this customer without success.
I reject this submission that Brent’s income in 2014 should be set at $52,000 because I do

not believe Brent’s evidence regarding his income. I also do not find that the medical evidencesupports a finding that Brent’s medical issues prevented him from being employed and earningincome and I impute an annual income to him of $82,000.
Year 2015

[91]

Brent submits that in 2015, his income should be based on $27,866 which is the income

that he earned from 244-9984 Ontario.

[92]

In the year 2015, Brent suffered from deep vein thrombosis complicated by pneumonia;

atrial fibrillation; congestive heart failure and severe sleep apnea which according to Dr. Mankal,deeply affected his function and quality of life. Further, the doctor stated in his report datedMarch 18, 2015 that he was not able to work and that he should avoid additional stress such ascourt proceedings for a 90 day period.

[93]

By letter dated March 31, 2015, Dr. Mankal confirmed that Brent suffered from atrial

fibrillation and congestive heart failure but that it had been stabilized by medication and he wasunder the care of a cardiologist. Further, he opined that Brent should avoid court proceedings orbusiness dealings but there was no reason, according to the doctor, to avoid driving or interactingwith his children.

[94]

Brent went to California for a procedure to deal with his medical issues. The attending

physician, Dr. Narayan, in his reports dated May 13 and June 16, 2015 indicated the Brentneeded to be excused from work, court or strenuous physical activities as a result of theprocedure as part of his recovery process. The procedure occurred on June 8, 2015. ByNovember 2015, the doctor confirmed the procedure was a success.

[95]

Based on the medical evidence, I find that Brent was not able to work in 2015 for part of

the year. However, Brent should have been able to work at the beginning and at the end of the

[90]

year. In the circumstances, I will impute an income to Brent of one third of $82,000 being
$27,000 which is consistent with Brent’s submission that he earned $27,000 in 2015. The table

Year 2016 going forward

[96]

In 2016, Brent was hospitalized for five days a result of having severe abdominal cramps

and vomiting while in California to see Dr. Narayan, as a follow-up to his procedure. There wereno further medical interventions in 2016 and in the letter from Dr. Mankal dated October 6, 2016
confirms that he is no longer taking medication for his atrial fibrillation but takes medication forhypertension.

[97]

I do not find that there was any medical reason why Brent could not work full time. Brent

now submits that he earned $45,000 in 2015 based on commissions from Totem Liquors.
However, for the reasons given though out this proceeding, I do not find that Brent is credibleand will impute an income to him of $82,000.
Child support payments made

[98]

Brent has made the following payments of child support:
(a)

$38,000 in May 2012 (at the same time he paid $30,000 on three credit cards toreduce the balance);

[99]

(b)

$12,300 in 2013;

(c)

$12,300 in 201;

(d)

no child support payments in 2015; and

(e)

no child support payments in 2016.

I find that there has not been a material change in Brent’s financial circumstances as of

August 2012 save and except the year 2015 where I fixed his income at $27,000.

amount of child support for two children is $397 per month.

[100] Lanita requests that the arrears of child support be payable in two instalments. I haveconsidered Brent’s ongoing obligation to pay $1198 per month, his imputed income of $82,000

commencing July 1, 2017 until paid in full.
Life Insurance

[101] Brent never complied with the Divorce Order of Justice Kershman dated August 23, 2012
to have life insurance in place to secure his child support obligation. Brent admitted in crossexamination that he was obligated to give Lanita confirmation that the life insurance was in placewithin one week but it was never done. He indicated he did not know why it was not provided.

[102] Despite being in breach of the terms of the Divorce Order, Brent seeks relief from thecourt to vary the order to remove his obligation to have life insurance.

[103] Based on Brent’s medical history, I do not have evidence that Brent has the ability tocurrently obtain life insurance. In the circumstances, I will not order Brent to obtain lifeinsurance that he cannot qualify for.

[104] However, I have jurisdiction to order that Brent’s child support obligation form the firstcharge on his estate. In the circumstances, I exercise my jurisdiction and make my orderaccordingly.

[105] Further, Lanita has bought a life insurance policy in 2012 on Brent’s life and has beenpaying the premiums. She seeks an order to have the monthly premiums included in the childsupport. I reject this request as I find that Brent does not have the ability to obtain his owninsurance policy. If Lanita wishes to have the insurance, it will be paid from the table childsupport.
ACCESS AND OTHER PARENTING ISSUES
Position of the parties

[106] Brent seeks the following:

per year and find that Brent should pay back the arrears, once calculated, at $1000 per month

(a)

an order that Brent be permitted to travel with the children, including internationaltravel, on the provision of a written itinerary including flight details (carrier and

departure;
(b)

an order that Lanita shall provide to Brent with the children’s passports and shallsign a travel consent letter to facilitate Brent’s travel with the children;

(c)

an order that Brent have access to the children as follows:
(i)

every second Friday from 4 p.m. to Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
except that access to commence on Friday at 10 a.m.
where the Friday that Brent would exercise access iseither a statutory holiday or a professional developmentday for the children;

(ii)

every Wednesday evening from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
except during Lanita’s summer vacation or Christmasbreak vacation with the children;

(iii) from December 26 at 7:30 p.m. to the children’s returnto school following the end of their Christmas break;
(iv) access from Saturday to Saturday during the children’sSpring Break in odd numbered years;
(v)

three weeks, no more than two of the week’sconsecutively, in each of July and August; and

(vi) if Lanita adjusts Brent’s weekend access with thechildren, that Brent be provided with an alternateweekend for access with the children to occur within 90
days of the adjusted weekend.

flight number) and accommodation location to Lanita within 10 days prior to two

[107] Lanita seeks the following:
(a)

that the order of The Honourable Justice Kershman dated September 10, 2012 be

(i) Brent’s Friday pick-up be changed to 4 p.m. and theSunday (or Monday on long weekends) drop off time bechanged to 7 p.m.;
(ii)

That all of Brent’s access with the children be confinedto the National Capital region and that Brent not bepermitted to travel with the children; and

(iii) Brent

shall surrender his Canadian passport,

his

American green card and any other travel documents hehas during his access time with the children.

[108] Despite Brent agreeing to having access to his children every second weekend, summerholidays and the like after August 2012, he was not involved in the children’s life until thesummer of 2013.

[109] Further, when he was away for this period of time, Brent refused to disclose his locationto Lanita. Brent currently has access every second weekend from Friday at 4 p.m. to Sunday at7:30 p.m. and every Wednesday from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

[110] Brent submits that as a result of the passage of time, the children are older and shouldhave more time with him and relies on the maximum contact principle set out in the Divorce Actregarding access by parents. Lanita submits that the children would not be properly cared for inBrent’s care and that he may disappear with the children.
Legislative framework

[111] Before the court makes a variation order in respect of a custody order, the court shallsatisfy itself that there has been a change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances

varied as follows:

of the child of the marriage occurring since the making of the custody order or the last variationorder made in respect of that order, as the case may be, and, in making the variation order, the

that change (Section 17 (5) Divorce Act).

[112] in making a variation order varying a custody order, the court shall give effect to theprinciple that a child of the marriage should have as much contact each former spouse as isconsistent with the best interest of the child and, for that purpose, where the variation orderwould grant custody of the child to a person who does not currently have custody, the court shalltake into consideration the willingness of that person to facilitate such contact (Section 17(10)
Divorce Act).
Analysis

[113] In 2012, at the time of the divorce order, the children were 6 and 8 years of age. Todaythe children are 11 and 13 years of age. It has been almost 5 years since the custody order.

[114] The father resides in Gatineau, Québec while the mother resides in Orleans, Ontario.

[115] With respect to the regular access, I find that it is in the best interest of the children tospend more time with their father because they are older and he has exercised access on aconsistent basis since 2014. I have also considered the principles in the Divorce Act and I do notaccept that the children are not properly cared for while they are in Brent’s care.

[116] Further based on Lanita’s consent and in keeping with the best interests of the children, I
order that Brent shall have access to the children every second Friday from 4 p.m. until Sundayat 7:30 p.m. with such access to start on Friday at 10 a.m. on the Fridays that the children have astatutory holiday or a professional development day.

[117] Further, I order that Brent shall have access every Wednesday evening from 4 p.m. to7:30 p.m. except during the summer vacation or Christmas break vacation at which time suchaccess will be suspended.

court shall take into consideration only the best interest of the child as determined by reference to

[118] With respect to summer holidays, I find that it is in the children’s best interests to havemore summer time with Brent. I reject his request that he have 6 weeks of summer vacation

order that Brent have access to the children for three non-consecutive weeks during thechildren’s summer school holiday.

[119] Regarding the Christmas break, the father wants 10 days while the mother seeks to splitthe Christmas holidays. The children have a two week Christmas school break every year. I findit is in the children’s best interest that this Christmas school break should be shared equally bythe parents. I order that both parents shall be entitled to one week each of the children’sChristmas school break. Brent shall have the children for the first half of the Christmas schoolbreak and Lanita the second half of the school break in odd numbered years and said schedule toalternate in even numbered years.

[120] Lanita’s concern that Brent is a flight risk and relies on information obtained about Brentby a private investigator that was retained to repossess a Lexus motor vehicle leased by Brent. I
find that Brent has used multiple date of births being April 25, 1958, April 26, 1958 and April15, 1958 associated with his name. He also has an American social insurance number and severalalias in the United States.

[121] With respect to Brent’s request to travel internationally with the children, I find that thereis a risk that Brent may leave the jurisdiction with the children. I base my findings on thefollowing factors:
(a)

in the past Brent has left Canada and did not advise Lanita as to his location;

(b)

Brent’s wife is Ukrainian national and has business interests in the Ukraine;

(c)

Brent has no assets in Canada;

(d)

Brent has significant arrears of child support;

(e)

Brent has an obligation to continue to pay child support;

because Lanita works fulltime and having found that Brent has the ability to work full time, I

(f)

Brent has been abusive to Lanita in the past resulting in his criminal conviction of

(g)

Brent is not a credible witness, and

(h)

Brent has a record of 12 possible aliases.

[122] Based on my findings of fact, I find there is a risk that Brent may remove the childrenoutside of the jurisdiction if he is granted permission to travel outside of Canada. I haveconsidered Lanita’s request that all of Brent’s access be in the National capital region, that Brentnot be permitted to travel with the children and that Brent surrender his Canadian passport,American green card and other travel documents.

[123] Having found that there is a risk that Brent may remove the children outside of thejurisdiction, I find that it is the best interests of the children that Brent’s access to the children beconfined to Canada.

[124] I find that the restriction of allowing Brent to have access to his children for vacation theNational Capital Region to be restrictive. However, Brent shall provide Lanita with a detaileditinerary, 30 days before leaving on vacation including the location of the vacation, the addressand the telephone number where the children can be reached.
Miscellaneous

[125] Lanita seeks an order that Brent is prevented from bringing any further motions. Brentopposes such an order. As the issue of child support and access is always variation subject to amaterial change in circumstances, I will not order that Brent is prohibited from bringing a motionin variation.

[126] Brent seeks an order that he not be required to obtain medical/dental benefits. I find thatat this time there is no evidence that Brent has or can qualify for such benefits and consequentlythis relief is granted.
