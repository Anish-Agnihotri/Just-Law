REASONS FOR DECISION - COSTS

[1]
In this case, a commercial tenant, Pet Valu Canada Inc., stopped paying rent and vacatedits premises in a plaza. The landlord, 7Marli Limited, did not re-enter to terminate the lease andinstead sued progressively for unpaid rent. The landlord moved for a partial summary judgmentfor some of that unpaid rent. I granted a partial summary judgment for $101,209.16. See 7MarliLimited v. Pet Valu Canada Inc., 2017 ONSC 1796. The landlord now seeks costs for the partialsummary judgment.

[2]
The landlord submitted a costs outline claiming $8,742.91, all inclusive. The costs outlineadvanced a claim for the partial summary judgment motion and for 25% of the time spent onpleadings, productions and discoveries. The landlord submitted that it was reasonable to assumethat 25% of the time spent on those steps was related to the issues raised on the summaryjudgment motion.

[3]
The tenant submitted that the amount claimed for costs was excessive and that theappropriate award is $4,500, all inclusive, which award would be just the costs of the partialsummary judgment motion.

[4]
I agree with the tenant that the costs should be just of the motion, with the costs for thetime spent on pleadings, productions, and discoveries all remaining to be determined in thecause. I also agree with the tenant that the quantum of costs should be $4,500 all inclusive. Orderaccordingly.
