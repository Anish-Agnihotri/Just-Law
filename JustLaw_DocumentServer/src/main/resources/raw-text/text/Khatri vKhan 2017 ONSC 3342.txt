[1]

Khatija Khatri commenced an application under the Rules of Civil

Procedure on August 14, 2012 to discharge various instruments Talat Khan hadregistered against title to a property known as Bellwood Farm. Talat Khan hadregistered those instruments under several orders that were later superseded bysteps taken in Ms. Khan’s family litigation against her former spouse, AbdulKhan.

Mr. Khan was the former owner who had transferred Bellwood Farm to

Ms. Khatri and her husband, Mohammed Munir Subhani, in September 1998.

within a separate action known as “the Brampton action” to which Mr. Khan andthe Khatija/Subhani owners are parties, Ms. Khan was successful in obtainingorders that essentially reinstated a Writ of Seizure and Sale that the lawyers forthe Khatija/Subhani owners had wrongfully removed from title in 2004.

[3]

Ms. Khatri now seeks her costs of the application. She claims costs on a

partial indemnity basis up to September 25, 2012 in the amount of $2,970, andcosts on a substantial indemnity basis from that date to judgment in the amountof $47,767.00, for total fees of $50,737.50 plus disbursements of $4,443.19. Thetotal costs claimed with HST add up to $62,289.71.

[4]

Ms. Khan resists this claim for costs for various reasons. She submits

that Ms. Khatri delayed in bringing her application for twelve years. Ms. Khanalso argues that Ms. Khatri should be denied costs because she has beenuncooperative and because she failed to take the wrongfully discharged W rit ofSeizure and Sale reinstated in the related motion into account. Ms. Khan arguesthat instead, she should be awarded the costs of the application on a partialindemnity basis in the amount of $55,877, or in the amount of $68,017 on asubstantial indemnity scale.

registrations vacated from title to Bellwood Farm. However, in a motion heard

[5]

The discretion of the court to grant costs under section 131(1) of the

Courts of Justice Act is subject to any statute or rule of court. In this application,the court is guided by Rule 57.01.

[6]

The Court of Appeal confirmed in Fong v. Chan 1999, 46 O.R. (3d) 330

that the objectives of the modern law of costs are to partially indemnifysuccessful litigants for the costs they have incurred, to encourage settlement,and to discourage inappropriate behaviour in the litigation.

[7]

Overall, the governing principle for the court to follow is to award costs

that are fair and reasonable to the parties. One measure of what is fair andreasonable is to determine what amount would be fair and reasonable for theunsuccessful party to pay: Boucher v. Public Accountants Council of Ontario

[2004] O.J. No. 2634 (Ont. C.A.). Even though the assessment of costs is not amechanical exercise that begins or ends with the calculation of hours and hourlyrates, the rates actually charged and fees billed to the successful litigant arerelevant considerations:

Stellarbridge Management Inc. v. Magna International

Inc. (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 263 (Ont. C.A.).

Basic Principles

[8]

While Mr. Speciale has made submissions on behalf of Ms. Khan that

Ms. Khatri should be denied her costs and that Ms. Khan is the deserving party, I
do not see any reason to depart from the customary rule that the successful partyis entitled to costs. The application Ms. Khatri commenced was a separateproceeding from the Brampton action in which Ms. Khan brought her motion. Ms.Khatri was the successful party on the application despite Mr. Speciale’sarguments to link them together for the purpose of determining the costs for theapplication. This is not a situation where either Rule 57.01(2) or the principlesdiscussed in Niagara Structured Steel (St. Catherine’s) v. W.D. LaFlama Ltd.
(1987) 58 O.R. (2d) 773 (Ont. C.A.) should be applied.

[9]

Ms. Khatri is therefore entitled to costs for her application. Mr. D’Agostino

submits on behalf of Ms. Khatri that she should be entitled to those costs on asubstantial indemnity basis because of an offer to settle he served as hercounsel. He submits that Ms. Khatri was as successful as the terms of that offerto settle and that she should have her costs on a substantial indemnity basisfrom the time the offer was served under Rule 49.10.

Discussion

[10]

There is no principled reason why the court should not give effect to Ms.

entitled to her costs of the application on a substantial indemnity basis.

[11]

This leaves the question of quantum to be decided. There are various

ways to measure what would be considered a fair and reasonable amountdiscussed in authorities such as Boucher and Stellarbridge. It is also relevant thatMr. Speciale claims almost as much for costs on a partial indemnity basis for Ms.Khan in this application as Mr. D’Agostino claims for the applicant’s costs on asubstantial indemnity level.

[12]

In my view, each of the parties has too grand a view of their conduct

compared to the other, and the claim for costs is too rich by half.

[13]

When I consider the conduct of Ms. Khan having regard to the objective

for awarding costs set out in Fong v. Chan, I am reminded that Ms. Khan and hercounsel were aggressively litigious throughout the application.

[14]

Although Ms. Khan agreed at all times to an order for the deletion from

title of the two non-depletion orders granted by Justice Simmons and registeredagainst title in 1993, she was not agreeable to delete the CPL registered in 1999.
That was the real reason the application was argued. Ms. Khatri should have hercosts to indemnify her for this application for the success achieved on this issue.

Khatri’s offer and to apply Rule 49.10 in these circumstances. Ms. Khatri is

[15]

Ms. Khatri’s costs should reflect the time and expense that Ms. Khan’s

relevant to this assessment. Subrule 57.01(1)(e) in particular applies as a factorbecause Ms. Khan delayed the application unnecessarily by asking for time tobring the competing motion for a new CPL.

[16]

The claim for a new CPL was requested by Ms. Khan from the outset in

the event the CPL registered in 1999 was ultimately vacated from title toBellwood Farm. This relief was initially requested in the responding materials Ms.Khan filed to the application. The process was delayed because Mr. Specialerequired the time to bring the motion for that relief in the Brampton action where itwas more appropriate place to seek that relief.

[17]

Ms. Khatri is not blameless for conduct and pace of the litigation. The

non-depletion orders had already been set aside by Justice Snowie in 2002 (seeparagraph 98 of the Reasons). The CPL obtained in 1999 had no force or effectafter Justice MacKenzie had set aside Justice Seppi’s order granting leave forthe CPL to issue in December 2000 (see paragraphs 50, 57, and 67). It shouldnot have taken Ms. Khatri twelve years and eight trips to court to obtain an orderto clear those items from title that were already within reach.

position throughout the application caused. The factors set out in Rule 57.01 are

[18]

Upon considering all of the circumstances and the principles of law

indemnity basis to Ms. Khatri in the amount of $25,000 for fees, HST of $3,250
and disbursements inclusive of HST in the amount of $4,956.33 for a total of
$33,206.33 as a baseline.

[19]

I say these costs are awarded as a baseline because the payment of

these costs is stayed until the costs of the motion Ms. Khan brought in theBrampton action have been determined as those costs relate to Ms. Khatri. Onlywhen those costs have been added or subtracted from the costs award for theapplication herein will the sum or difference be payable.
