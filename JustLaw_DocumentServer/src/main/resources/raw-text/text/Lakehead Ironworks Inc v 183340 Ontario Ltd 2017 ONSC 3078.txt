Mr. Justice D.C. ShawReasons On Motion for Judgment

[1]

This motion was originally brought as a summary judgment motion. However, at the

beginning of the hearing of the motion, counsel agreed that it should be treated as a motion underRule 49.09 to enforce what the plaintiffs submit was a settlement agreement.

[2]

The issue is whether a binding agreement for the purchase and sale of shares in a private

corporation was reached in an exchange of e-mails between the plaintiff, Uwe Quast, and thedefendant, Andrew Locke.

-2------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BackgroundLakehead Ironworks Inc. was incorporated in 1990. Its head office is in Thunder Bay. It

carries on business as a manufacturer and installer of steel and iron products. Mr. Quast was thesole shareholder.

[4]

In 2008, Mr. Locke became an employee of the company. In lieu of paying Mr. Locke a

larger salary, Mr. Quast transferred to Mr. Locke 20% of the shares in Lakehead Ironworks Inc.

[5]

In 2011, Mr. Quast and Mr. Locke transferred their shares into their respective holding

companies. Mr. Locke’s shares were held by his holding company, the defendant 183340 OntarioLtd.

[6]

The parties never executed a shareholders agreement.

[7]

The relationship between Mr. Quast and Mr. Locke deteriorated. In August 2014, Mr.

Locke quit his employment with Lakehead Ironworks Inc.

[8]

In September 2014, Mr. Quast offered to buy Mr. Locke’s shares for $50,000, with taxes

to be covered by Mr. Quast. Mr. Locke did not accept the offer.

[9]

In December 2014, Mr. Locke, together with his holding company, brought an

application against Lakehead Ironworks Inc. and Mr. Quast under s. 248 and s. 207 of theOntario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.B.16, seeking a remedy for allegedoppression.

-3------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[10] In February 2015, Mr. Quast met with Mr. Locke’s counsel, Mr. Evan Juurakko,

an e-mail to Mr. Juurakko:
Hey EvanThe meeting yesterday was quite informative. I think that Andy is under theimpression that the value of the corporation is much larger than it actually is.
Andy was my partner for six years and during that time, I’ve learn [sic] a bit of hismentality. I believe that once he gets something in his mind, he will not sway nomatter how irrational it is. I believe the moneys [sic] he’s expecting is far from theactual value of the shares. Peter is an expert in the evaluation of minority sharepurchases. The maximum I’m will [sic] to pay taking all parameters into play,including Minority shareholder discount is $100,000.00.
I have retained my longtime friend, Gavin Freitag. I have a meeting tomorrow, and I
am preparing for this proceeding to go to court.

[11]

Mr. Juurakko responded to Mr. Quast by e-mail on February 25, 2015 and advised that

Mr. Locke had instructed him to decline the $100,000 offer. He further advised that Mr. Lockehad instructed him to propose that the parties enter into a consent order whereby Mr. Lockewould pay for a valuation and Mr. Quast would purchase Mr. Locke’s share based on thevaluation without a minority shareholder discount.

[12]

Mr. Locke’s February 25, 2015 offer was not accepted by Mr. Quast.

[13]

The oppression application was heard in December 2015 by Justice Pierce. Judgment was

released on March 16, 2016. Justice Pierce dismissed the application for a declaration ofoppression. Justice Pierce ordered that the parties were to agree on a business valuation todetermine the fair market value of Mr. Locke’s shares, with the valuation to be paid, in the firstinstance, by Lakehead Ironworks Inc. She ordered that there be a trial of an issue to determine

regarding possible settlement of the application. The next day, February 18, 2015, Mr. Quast sent

[14]

On March 30, 2016, two weeks after Justice Pierce released her judgment, Mr. Quast sent

an e-mail to his lawyer, Mr. Dan Matson, and to Mr. Juurakko and Mr. Locke. In part, the e-mailstated:
Now my counsellor Dan Matson had repeatedly stated, offer the $100,000 again. I
say “Fuck that”, I paid Andy the same wage as I paid myself and he brought minimalstuff to the table. I gave, for $1.00 20% of a company that I have been involved in for43 years, a family borne company and now I’m obligated to buy back the shares thatI gave him, screw that…. Come April 18th the offer will stand at $80k.

[15]

On April 5, 2016, Mr. Locke sent the following e-mail to Mr. Quast:
Hey UweI’ve thought it over and you are right.
Us being on good terms is important to me. I will accept your offer of $100,000 formy shares.
I will have Evan draw up an agreement and send it to Dan.

[16]

Approximately ten minutes later, Mr. Quast e-mailed back to Mr. Locke:
Hey AndyHow about I pass it on to John Luft. Let him draw something up, I’ll cover the costsfor accountant, and you have your lawyer review.

[17]

Mr. Luft was an accountant with LCPS, Chartered Accounts, the accountants for

Lakehead Ironworks Inc., Mr. Quast and Mr. Locke.

[18]

On April 8, 2016, Mr. Locke sent Mr. Quast an e-mail, asking if Mr. Quast would like to

join him for lunch on the following Monday. Mr. Quast declined the invitation by return e-mail

No problem.
I just want to apologize to you in person for what I put you through and to make surethat we are cool moving forwards.
Andy

[19]

Mr. Quast e-mailed a response that same day, setting out at some length that he was not

ready to have lunch. He concluded with:
Let’s get through this last deal of me buying back something I gave for free…
perhaps some time in the future we can sit back and talk as friends…. I’m curious onhow the Alpacas are doing.
Uwe

[20]

Mr. Quast retained a lawyer, Mr. Brian MacIvor, to complete the share transfer in

conjunction with the accountants, LCPS.

[21]

Mr. Quast deposes that he was advised by Mr. Bert Watts of LCPS that Mr. Watts on

multiple occasions requested that Mr. Locke provide him with the minute book for Mr. Locke’sholding company, 183340 Ontario Inc., with no response.

[22]

On April 25, 2016, Mr. Watts sent an e-mail to Lakehead Ironworks Inc. and Mr. Locke:
Good Day Gentlemen,I want to ensure that everyone is going to be on the same page with regards to theshare purchase transaction. After speaking with Brian Maclvor, the following shouldoccur:
- If not already done, the minute books for Lakehead Ironworks, 1833339
Ontario Ltd. and 1833340 Ontario Ltd. need to get to Brian’s office (1151
Barton Street) as soon as possible as they need at least a weeks time toprepare the paperwork and cannot proceed without the minute books;

April 8, 2016:

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

-6------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The shares of 1833340 Ontario Ltd. (Andy’s Corp) will be purchased by1833339 Ontario Ltd. (Uwe’s Corp) for $100,000;
- Once the shares are purchased, 1833339 Ontario Ltd. will own 1833340
Ontario Ltd. and Andy will no longer have ownership of that corporation;
- Andy will receive the $100K from the share purchase, which in turn will bereported on his tax return. The shares are anticipated to be QSBC (QualifiedSmall Business Corporation) shares which would make them eligible for thelifetime capital gain deduction and therefore this amount should essentially bereceived tax free;It would be best for the transaction to occur as of May1, 2016, as the “change incontrol” would be aligned with the year end date and would allow 1833340 OntarioLtd. to avoid additional filing requirements (i.e. upon the deemed year end at thetime of acquisition of control).
If anyone has any questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.
Take care,Bert.

[23]

Mr. Quast e-mailed Mr. Juurakko that same day:
Hi EvanCan you get Andy to get this together? Not sure what the issues are now as Bert
(accountant) has asked for this previously.
Uwe

[24]

On April 28, 2016, Mr. Quast e-mailed Mr. Watts to inquire if Mr. Locke had gotten

back to him.

[25]

Mr. Watts replied by e-mail on April 28, 2016:
Hey UweAndy gave me a call earlier this week and it appears that the minute book is notgoing to be going over to MacIvor’s office.

Mr. Quast sent an e-mail the next day, April 29, 2016, to Mr. Juurakko:
Hi EvanSo Dan tells me you had a conversation. And Andy will proceed with theaccountant’s plan if he receives a letter of guarantee from Dan, is that correct?

Uwe

[27]

The transfer of Mr. Locke’s shares did not take place.

[28]

Mr. Quast submits that there was a binding settlement created when, on April 5, 2016,

Mr. Locke accepted Mr. Quast’s offer of February 18, 2015 to purchase Mr. Locke’s shares for
$100,000. Mr. Quast submits that all the essential terms of a settlement were agreed to and thatMr. Locke failed to comply with the terms of the settlement. Mr. Quast submits that pursuant toRule 49.09, this court should grant judgment requiring Mr. Locke to transfer his shares from hisholding company to Mr. Quast’s holding company.

[29]

Mr. Locke submits that there was no settlement. Mr. Locke emphasizes that in his April

5, 2016 e-mail, when he stated that he would accept Mr. Quast’s offer of $100,000 for his shares,he also said that he would have Mr. Juurakko draw up an agreement and send it to Mr. Matson.
Mr. Locke submits that a further written agreement was an essential term of a settlement.

[30]

In cross-examination on his affidavit filed on the motion, Mr. Locke agreed that he did

not have a problem with Mr. Quast’s suggestion in Mr. Quast’s April 5, 2016 e-mail that Mr.

-8------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luft would draw something up for Mr. Locke’s lawyer to review and that Mr. Quast would cover

[31]

Mr. Locke also agreed in cross-examination that Mr. Watts had asked him a couple of

times to drop off his minute book. He said that he would not do so until he had read a draftagreement. He agreed that he did not tell anyone that he would only drop off his minute book ifhe received a draft agreement. He acknowledged in cross-examination that one of the reasons hedid not drop off the minute book was because he was having second thoughts about the $100,000
purchase price. He agreed that it was possible that even if he had an agreement drawn up, hemight still refuse to close for $100,000. He said that he was waiting for a draft agreement that hewould review and that any items that were missed or needed to be changed would have to beaddressed.

[32]

Mr. Locke submits:
1. There was no mutual intention to create a binding agreement;2. There was no agreement on all essential terms of the alleged settlement;3. The alleged settlement was an unenforceable agreement to agree;4. The parties did not act as if a settlement had been reached in the immediate aftermathof the April 5, 2016 e-mail from Mr. Locke;5. If there was a settlement, it was either repudiated or rescinded by Mr. Quast; and6. If there was a settlement, this court should exercise its discretion not to enforce it.

Court File No:CV-16-0407

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

-9------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[33]
The test to be applied on a motion under Rule 49.09 is: (1) was an agreement to settle

(3d) 218 (C.A.); Bank of Montreal v. Ismail, 2012 ONCA 129.

[34]

[35]

The first step of the test should be approached like a summary judgment motion.
The principles in determining whether a settlement agreement was concluded are set out

in Olivieri v. Sherman et al. (2007), 86 OR. (3d) 778 (C.A.) at para. 41:
A settlement agreement is a contract. Thus, it is subject to the general law of contractregarding offer and acceptance. For a concluded contract to exist, the court must findthat the parties: (1) had a mutual intention to create a legally binding contract; and
(2) reached agreement on all of the essential terms of the settlement: BawitkoInvestments Ltd. v. Kernels Popcorn Inc., [1991] O.J. o. 495, 79 D.L.R. (4th ) 97
(C.A.), at pp. 103-104 D.L.R.

[36]

I am satisfied that the first requirement of a mutual intention to create a legally binding

contract was met. Mr. Locke wanted to sell his shares. Mr. Quast wanted to buy them. Mr. Quastmade a written offer to purchase the shares at $100,000. Mr. Locke wrote that he would acceptMr. Quast’s offer of $100,000 for his shares.

[37]

A determination of the second requirement of a meeting of the minds on the essential

terms of a settlement does not require an inquiry into the parties’ subjective intentions. Becausein this case there was an exchange of e-mails, the issue is to be determined by an objectivereading of the contents of the e-mails. As observed in Olivieri, at para. 44, where the language inquestion is in writing, the law judges a person’s intentions by his outward expressions: “If hiswords or acts, judged by a reasonable standard manifest an intention to agree in regard to thematter in question, that agreement is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real butunexpressed state of mind on the subject.”

reached and, (2) if so, should it be enforced on all the evidence: Milios v. Zagas (1998), 38 OR.

Court File No:CV-16-0407

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

- 10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[38] Mr. Locke submits that there was no agreement on all the essential terms because one of

outstanding oppression application, costs of preparing the shareholders agreement, the taximplications of the share transfer, timelines regarding the completion of the transfer, release ofMr. Locke from a personal guarantee and general mutual releases.

[39]

I conclude from an objective reading of the February 18, 2015 e-mail from Mr. Quast and

the April 5, 2016 e-mail from Mr. Locke that there was a binding offer and acceptance of theessential terms of a contract between them, namely that Mr. Quast would purchase Mr. Locke’sshares for $100,000. I do not read Mr. Locke’s words, “I will have Evan draw up an agreementand send it to Dan”, as rendering the e-mail exchange an agreement to agree or a conditionalagreement. As observed by the Court of Appeal in Olivieri, at para. 46, if Mr. Locke hadintended that his acceptance of Mr. Quast’s $100,000 was only conditional, “…one would haveexpected to see language that expressly made one or more terms ‘subject to’ further agreement.”

[40]

In my opinion, Mr. Locke’s submissions that items such as costs, taxes, timelines for

completion and releases had to be agreed upon before there was a contract relate to thecompletion or implementation of the agreement, not to whether there was an agreement.

[41]

In Perri v. Concordian Chesterfield Co., [2003] O.J. No. 5852 (S.C.J.), Himel J. held

that on a motion for judgment, the court will enforce a settlement where the parties have agreedon the essential times of the settlement. However, she observed, at para. 8:
The terms regarding the method of payment, the exchange of releases andallocation of funds were merely matters incidental to the essential terms ofagreement which were to pay $50,000 to the plaintiff in full satisfactions ofclaim. In that there was an unconditional offer and acceptance, I exercise

thethethemy

the essential terms was a requirement for a written contract to deal with issues of costs of the

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

- 11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------discretion and grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff in accordance with the offerof settlement made by the defendants and accepted by the plaintiff.
In my view, when Mr. Locke agreed to accept $100,000 cash for his shares, it is

reasonable to imply that the parties would, in the usual course, execute mutual releases and thatpayment of the $100,000 would be made within a reasonable time. Mr. Watts in fact suggested aclosing date of May 1, 2016 to align with Lakehead Ironworks Inc.’s year end, approximatelythree weeks after Mr. Locke’s acceptance.

[43]

Mr. Locke did not make the agreement conditional upon income tax implications, costs

of the oppression application or an indemnity agreement.

[44]

Mr. Watts’ e-mail of April 25, 2016 indicates that although Mr. Locke would have to

report the $100,000 on his income tax return, the amount would essentially be received tax freebecause the shares were eligible for the lifetime capital gains exemptions.

[45]

With respect to Mr. Locke’s submission that the parties did not act as if there was a

settlement, Mr. Locke wrote Mr. Quast on April 8, 2016, three days after he accepted Mr.Quast’s offer, asking Mr. Quast to join him for lunch. After Mr. Quast declined, Mr. Lockewrote Mr. Quast again that day saying that he just wanted to apologize to Mr. Quast in person
“…for what I put you through and to make sure that we are cool moving forward.” Mr. Quastresponded on April 8, 2016, “Let’s get through this last deal….”. These e-mails do not indicatethat either party was acting as if there was no settlement. To the contrary, the e-mails read as ifboth parties accepted that there was an agreement and that they would be moving on.

[46]

I conclude that after April 8, 2016, Mr. Locke began to reconsider what he had agreed

upon and declined to act upon Mr. Watts’ requests to deliver his minute book. One can

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

- 12 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------reasonably gather from Mr. Locke’s cross-examination that he had second thoughts about the

had ordered. In my view, there was a binding agreement that Mr. Locke breached. Mr. Lockesignalled his breach in failing or refusing to take reasonable steps to implement the agreement bydelivering his minute book as requested by the parties’ mutual accountant, Mr. Watts.

[47]

The issue then becomes what was the legal effect, if any, of Mr. Quast’s e-mail of April

29, 2016 to Mr. Juurakko. I will repeat, the salient part of that e-mail for ease of reference.
So Dan tells me you had a conversation. And Andy will proceed with theaccountant’s plan if he receives a letter of guarantee from Dan, is that correct?
Ok the offer is now $98,800 to cover wasteful expenses. I’m tired of dishing outmonies for nothing.
Uwe

[48]

Mr. Locke submits that if I find that there was an agreement, this e-mail constituted a

repudiation of the agreement. I disagree. In my view, it was Mr. Locke who breached theagreement by failing to take reasonable steps to implement it.

[49]

In the alternative, Mr. Locke submits that if there was an agreement, and Mr. Quast is the

innocent party, Mr. Quast’s April 29, 2016 e-mail rescinded the agreement.

[50]

On that issue, Mr. Quast submits that the breach of the agreement by Mr. Locke

crystalized on April 28, 2016 when Mr. Locke made it clear that he was not going to completethe agreement and, that on that date, Mr. Quast had a cause of action. Mr. Quast submits that hisApril 29, 2016 e-mail stating that “…the offer is now $98,800…”, was an offer to settle thecause of action that had arisen on April 28, 2016.

repudiation, at paras. 39 and 40:
39 A fundamental confusion seems to exist over the meaning of the terms
“rescission” and “repudiation”. This confusion is not a new one, as it has plaguedcommon law jurisdictions for years. [page 440] Rescission is a remedy available tothe representee, inter alia, when the other party has made a false or misleadingrepresentation. A useful definition of rescission comes from Lord Atkinson in AbramSteamship Co. v. Westville Shipping Co., [1923] A.C. 773 (H.L.), at p. 781:
Where one party to a contract expresses by word or act in an unequivocal mannerthat by reason of fraud or essential error of a material kind inducing him to enter intothe contract he has resolved to rescind it, and refuses to be bound by it, theexpression of his election, if justified by the facts, terminates the contract, puts theparties in status quo ante and restores things, as between them, to the position inwhich they stood before the contract was entered into.
See similarly G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Contract in Canada (3rd ed. 1994), at p.
807.
40 Repudiation, by contrast, occurs “by word; or conduct evincing an intention notto be bound by the contract. It was held by the Privy Council in Clausen v. CanadaTimber & Lands,Ltd. [[1923] 4 D.L.R. 751], that such an intention may be evincedby a refusal to perform, even though the party refusing mistakenly thinks that he isexercising a contractual right” (S. M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts (4th ed.
1999), at para. 620). Contrary to rescission, which allows the rescinding party to treatthe contract as if it were void ab initio, the effect of a repudiation depends on theelection made by the non-repudiating party. If that party treats the contract as stillbeing in full force and effect, the contract “remains in being for the future on bothsides. Each (party) has a right to sue for damages for past or future breaches”
(emphasis in original): Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston's Law of Contract (12th ed.
1991), by M. P. Furmston, at p. 541. If, however, the non-repudiating party acceptsthe repudiation, the contract is terminated, and the parties are discharged from futureobligations. Rights and obligations that have already matured are not extinguished.
Furmston, supra, at pp. 543-44.

[52]

The Court observed at para. 41 that problems have arisen from misuse of the word

“rescission” to describe an accepted repudiation.

(S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada discussed the distinction between rescission and

Lakehead Ironworks Inc. v. 183340 Ontario Ltd.
Court File No:CV-16-0407

Reasons on Motion for JudgmentMr. Justice D.C. Sh aw

- 14 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[53]
In the instant case, there was a binding agreement which Mr. Locke breached when he

put to his election as the non-repudiating party. He could treat the contract as still being in forceand sue for damages for the breach. Or, Mr. Quast could accept the repudiation, in which casethe contract was terminated and he and Mr. Locke would be discharged from their respectivefuture obligations, namely to effect the transfer of Mr. Locke’s shares in consideration of thepayment of $100,000.

[54]

In my view, when Mr. Quast wrote on April 29, 2016 that “…the offer is now

$98,800….”, he was evincing his intention to treat the contract to purchase Mr. Locke’s sharesfor $100,000 as at an end. He accepted Mr. Locke’s repudiation with both parties then beingdischarged from further performance under the agreement.

[55]

Payment of $100,000 was an essential term of the agreement. When Mr. Quast informed

Mr. Locke that he would now only pay $98,800 for the shares, Mr. Quast effectively told Mr.Locke that he no longer considered himself bound to pay the agreed upon price. This was acommunication by Mr. Quast that he regarded the agreement as at an end because of Mr. Locke’sconduct and that he was now proposing a new contract, an essential term of which was paymentof an amount reduced from the original amount upon which the parties had agreed.

[56]

I cannot accept Mr. Quast’s submission that his April 29, 2016 offer of $98,800 was only

an offer to settle his cause of action for a breach of contract which had crystalized on April 28,2016. There is nothing in Mr. Quast’s e-mail of April 29, 2016 to support an interpretation thatMr. Quast was electing to treat the contract to purchase the shares for $100,000 as still being in

made clear by his conduct that he did not intend to be bound by the contract. Mr. Quast was then

their agreement and regarded his obligation under the agreement to pay $100,000 as at an end. Ifthe shares were to be transferred there would be a new agreement for payment of $98,800.

[57]

I appreciate that the e-mails which resulted in the formation on the contract and the

acceptance of the repudiation were authored by the parties and not by their lawyers.
Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the intentions of the parties can reasonably be determined froman objective reading of their e-mails.

Conclusion

[58]

For the reasons given, the plaintiffs’ motion for judgment is dismissed.

[59]

The parties have agreed that this action should be consolidated with the application in

No. CV-14-0520, which is the oppression application that was before Justice Pierce and whichinvolves the same parties. An order shall go, on consent, that this action, No. CV-16-0407, andthe application in No. CV-14-0520, be heard at the same time.
Costs

[60]

If the parties are unable to agree upon costs, the defendants shall deliver written

submissions within 20 days. The plaintiffs shall deliver their written submissions within 15 daysof service of the defendants’ submissions. Submissions shall not exceed five written pages,exclusive of Bills of Costs.

reasonable interpretation of the e-mail is that Mr. Quast accepted Mr. Locke’s repudiation of
