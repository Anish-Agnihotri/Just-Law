Background and Issues

[1]

This application was started in May of 2010. It finally came on for trial in May 2017.
During the course of the proceeding, the parties settled the issues of custody and access,the table amount for child support and periodic spousal support. The remaining issues fortrial are:
i)

equalization of net family property, including the division of householdgoods, furniture, electronics, tools, sports and hobby equipment andpersonal items;

ii)

post-separation adjustments to the net family property determinatio n;

ONTARIO

iii)

the applicant’s claim under s.7 of the Child Support Guidelines for childsupport over and above the table amount; and

iv)

the applicants claim for a lump sum for spousal support.

Equalization of Net Family Property

[2]

The parties dispute the date of separation, the applicant asserting a date of January 1,2010 and the respondent a date of November 9, 2009. As a practical matter, to limit thecost of the dispute, the parties agreed early on that the valuation date for net familyproperty purposes would be January 1, 2010 with one exception. The exception relates toa significant back injury sustained by the applicant December 29, 2009 which ultimatelyresulted in her spending some $22,500 for remedial surgery in the United States. She hadclaimed that expense as a “contingent liability” on the date of separation in her net familyproperty calculation, but ultimately abandoned that claim at trial. In the end, it is notnecessary for the court to determine the effective date of separation.

[3]

The parties have also agreed on the v-date values of many of the assets and debts had byeach. This decision will only address those items they have not agreed upon.
Household Goods and Furniture, Electronics, Tools, Sports and Hobby Equipment andPersonal Items.

[4]

There is no valuation evidence from either side, only the self-serving guestimates of theparties themselves. It is not even clear in the evidence who kept what items. At the dateof separation, Mr. Silverthorn said he wanted his personal items, tools, motorcycle partsand clothing and hunting and fishing gear. Had he received all those items he was contentthat Ms. Heffren retain everything else they owned within the home as an even trade.
Twenty months or more post separation, Mr. Silverthorn was still trying to arrange a timeto pick up his belongings from the matrimonial home. Ms. Heffren had obtained an orderfor exclusive possession of the home. Mr. Silverthorn’s repeated efforts through theirlawyers to arrange a pick-up time were to no avail. His unsuccessful effort is documentedand persuades me that an adjustment should be made in the net family propertycalculation in his favor to reflect the difference in value between what each spouseultimately received. Mrs. Heffren’s animus towards Mr. Silverthorn continues today. I
have no hesitation in finding that she had both the motive and the opportunity to keep thelion’s share of their personal property.

[5]

Mr. Silverthorn is entitled to the immediate delivery of the tool cabinet and anyremaining tools, motorcycle parts and equipment and his golf clubs. In addition, Ms.Heffren’s share under this category will include $5,000 more than Mr.Silverthorn’s, toreflect the difference in value between what she kept and what Mr. Silverthorn receivedor will receive.

[6]

I fix the value at $1,500 based on the husband’s admitted value in his financial statementand the absence of any evidence to support a higher figure except for the wife’sunqualified opinion.
2003 Suzuki LTR 400 Eiger Quad

[7]

This vehicle is still in the husband’s name, but Ms. Heffren has retained possession of itsince separation and wanted to keep it at that time. The parties agree the value is $3,000
at v-date. The husband is ordered to transfer ownership of the vehicle to Mrs. Heffrenforthwith and the $3,000 value will be included in her net family property.
Husband’s 2000 GMC Sierra

[8]

This vehicle had 250,000 km on it at the date of separation. There is independentevidence of extensive rust damage by 2011. The husband spent $2,400 on repairs beforereceiving $3,700 sometime later on as a trade-in. The applicant’s unsupported opinion ofthe value ($9,000) seems quite unrealistic. I fix the value of the vehicle at $3,700.
Wife’s 2007 Suzuki XL7

[9]

This vehicle was purchased about eight months before separation for $17,000 or $18,000
as part of a sell off by the husband’s employer. The MSRP was about $30,000. Ms.Heffren agreed in her testimony that they got a “fantastic deal” on the vehicle and that thefair market value was greater than the price they paid. I have no doubt that this vehiclewas worth $16,000 on v-date as Mr. Silverthorn contends. Evidence of the subsequenttrade-in value is irrelevant because the vehicle was extensively damaged post-separation.
1984 Suzuki Tempter Motorcycle

[10]

The motorcycle was at the husband’s mother’s home on v-date and overlooked in hisfinancial disclosure. It was not road worthy. The photograph of the vehicle leads me toconclude that the vehicle is not worth much more than the husband’s opinion of $200 andless than the wife’s opinion of $800 I fix the value at $400.
RRSP Intended for Lauren Silverthorn

[11]

The respondent purchased this RRSP for his daughter Lauren before his marriage to theapplicant. I need not guess at how much it appreciated in value during the marriagebecause I find the respondent is a mere trustee. Lauren is the beneficial owner of theaccount. It is not to be included in the respondent’s net family property.

Husband’s 1986 Kawasaki Motorcycle

[12]

The parties now agree the respondent assumed this overdraft. The v-date amount was
$685.54.
Prime Financial Credit Union Account Number xxxx 578

[13]

The parties now agree the balance in the applicant’s account on v-date is $136.61.
Canada Savings Bonds

[14]

The applicant overlooked this item in her financial disclosure. She admits that $3,692
should be added to her net family property.
Bank of Montreal Account Number xxxx670

[15]

The applicant also overlooked disclosing particulars of this account, necessitatingtestimony from a bank employee at trial. The amount to be added to the applicant’s netfamily property per Exhibit 8 is $70.61.
Edward Jones CI Investment

[16]

I accept the applicant’s testimony that approximately $400 was held in her name whenher baseball team and its social arm stopped functioning. I accept that, notwithstandingthe T5 slip on her 2009 tax return, she held this asset as a mere trustee at the date ofseparation. It is not included in her net family property.
Money Advanced to Lauren Silverthorn for Educational Costs

[17]

The applicant says that the parties loaned Lauren $3,900. There is no evidence ofrepayment. The respondent says there was never any expectation of repayment. It doesnot matter either way. On the wife’s own version, the money came from the joint accountof the parties and would be a debt equally owed to the two of them. It therefore does notfactor into the bottom line of any equalization payment.
Other Money Receivable

[18]

Thirteen or fourteen months before separation, the applicant wrote a cheque for $4,000
on the joint line of credit. The respondent alleges that she loaned this money to her friendElisa Ilic for a car. The applicant does not recall what the cheque was for but vehementlydenies that she loaned her destitute friend money she knew could not be repaid. Thecheque was not produced nor did the respondent seek to call Ms. Ilic as a witness. I amnot satisfied the respondent has met the onus of proof.

BMO Joint Account Number xxxx-057

CIBC Line of Credit

[19]

The parties now agree that $936.21 should be shown as a debt of the respondent eventhough the line of credit was in joint names on v-date.
Notional Tax on RRSP’s

[20]

The parties now agree that notional tax is to be included in the net family propertycalculation; $1,365.00 as a liability of the respondent and $1,494.94 for the applicant.
BMO Joint Credit Card Number xxxx5617

[21]

Whatever the balance on the date of separation, the balance is 50/50 and thereforeirrelevant to the bottom line calculation of an equalization payment.
Wife’s Credit Cards with Home Depot, HBC and PC Financial MasterCard

[22]

Though she has provided statements for the months after the separation (February andMarch 2010), the applicant has not provided any statement of the balances owing on vdate. She cannot be sure that these cards were not used between January 1, 2010 and thedate of the statements she produced. She has not met the onus of proof under s. 4(3) ofthe Family Law Act and cannot deduct these minor debts.
Wife’s Car Loan

[23]

The respondent confirmed that when the wife’s Suzuki vehicle was purchased at thecompany sell off in the spring of 2009 almost all of the purchase price was financed.
Though there is no documentary evidence of the loan balance I accept the applicant’sfigure of $14,000 because few payments would have been made since the date ofpurchase eight months earlier.
Property, Debts and Liabilities on Date of Marriage

[24]

The applicant was a student when the parties married. It is likely she had no significantassets. She had a leased Sunfire motor vehicle. The respondent had been working at Camiand owned a ten year old truck, hunting and fishing gear and some tools. I find that thenet difference in their net wealth at the date of marriage was $4000 in favor of therespondent, an amount that barely exceeds the applicant’s own estimate.
Conclusion

-5-

[25]

The application of these findings applied to the net family property calculations filed asexhibits at trial (with other agreed upon items and figures) leads me to conclude that theapplicant owes the respondent an equalization payment of $13,031.07. If counselcalculate the figure differently or are unable to agree upon the calculation, brief writtensubmissions may be made within the next 30 days.

Post-Separation Adjustments to the Net Family Property Calculation

[26]

Part way through the trial the parties entered into partial minutes of settlement marked asExhibit 25 in which they agree that the applicant is indebted to the respondent in the sumof $15,000 for post-separation adjustments. This provision is to be incorporated into thefinal order. Those same minutes of settlement also provide for a mechanism in relation toa replacement cheque from the township of Malahide. Paragraph 2 of Exhibit 25 shallalso be incorporated into the final order.

Child Support

[27]

The parties settled the question of the table amount of child support before trial. Anorder has already been granted in relation to that aspect of the child support claim,reserving for this trial the applicant’s claim for s.7 expenses, both retroactively and as anongoing item.

[28]

With any expense under s.7 of the guidelines the court must consider:
1) the necessity of the expense having regard to the child’s best interests2) the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the parents, and3) the spending pattern of the parents during cohabitation.

[29]

In the case of educational or extracurricular activities there is an additional qualifier; theexpense must be “extraordinary”. Seemingly inconsistent jurisprudence on whatconstituted an “extraordinary” educational or extracurricular expense prompted anamendment to the guidelines. Under s.7(1.1)(a) the starting point is whether the expenses
“exceed those that the spouse requesting an amount for the extraordinary expenses canreasonably cover, taking into account that spouses income and the amount that the spousewould receive under the applicable table…”

[30]

In this case the applicant claims $24,131 for historical s.7 expenses, $16,182 of whichrelate to tutoring and extracurricular activities over the last six years. In 2011, when theclaim was first asserted, her income was less than $60,000 annually. Following her returnto work in December 2011 her income rose steadily to over $100,000 in 2015, where ithas levelled off. When the application was started in 2010 the table amount of childsupport payable by the respondent on his annual income of $79,400 would have been

-6-

-7-

[31]

Going forward the tutoring and extracurricular activities the boys are still undertakingwill range between $4,000 and $5,000 annually.

[32]

I find on the first part of the extraordinary expense question under s.7(1.1)(a) that Ms.Heffren could reasonably cover most of the expenses claimed, but not the totality ofthem. I turn next to s.7(1.1)(b). It is appropriate to break down the extracurricularactivities and consider each one separately. Many of them are minor expenses that shouldbe subsumed in the table amount or by the applicant’s own income. I find that theapplicant’s expenses for baseball, soccer, swimming, cadets and school trips fall into thatcategory and do not qualify.

[33]

However, I find that the music expenses for Kael do qualify under this subsection of theguidelines. Kael has been devoted to his music studies since a young age. He hasdemonstrated special talent. Music has become more than a mere recreational activity forhim. His invitation to an advanced level military camp for six weeks this summer is theproduct of his musical versatility and skill with several instruments. His participation atthe camp may pave the way to Royal Military College and his dream of veterinarymedicine. There is a realistic possibility his music will lead to a post-secondaryscholarship. In that sense the cost may prove to be an investment, not just an expense.
The cost of lessons is significant, especially in the context of the other activities theapplicant is paying for outside the “extraordinary” catchment. The cost of his violin oughtto be included as it was within a reasonable cost range. I also include the music expensesfor Jesse for 2010-2012 because they continue a pre-separation activity and for most ofthat period the applicant was on disability with significantly less income.

[34]

I accept the applicant’s evidence that she has paid $12,377 in the past for the musiclessons. She first advanced her claim early in this litigation in early 2011.There is noreason to deny any of the older expenses.

[35]

The respondent is ordered to pay 45 percent of the $12,377 ($5,570) for the period todate. Going forward he is to pay that same percentage, which approximates the pro-ratedincomes of the parents. Going forward he is only required to reimburse the applicantupon presentation of a third-party receipt for the expense. The modest children’s activitytax credit has been discontinued and is not a significant factor.

[36]

Mr. Silverthorn admits the tutoring expenses qualify under s.7. He is ordered to pay 45
percent of the $2,875.00 paid by the applicant, $1293.75.

[37]

The remaining s.7 expenses do not have to be extraordinary to qualify. The test iswhether they are necessary and reasonable in all of the circumstances.

between $1,100 and $1,200 monthly. In subsequent years it would have risen by about anadditional $100 monthly.

[38]

The respondent accepts that the art therapy expense ($800) qualifies under s.7. He isordered to pay 45 percent, $360.

[39]

The dental expenses claimed do not meet the test of necessity. They could have been paidby the respondent’s plan had they been submitted. Alternatively the applicant could haveopted to expand her own group coverage as she was later ordered to do. With an order inplace requiring both parents to include the children on their group insurance there shouldbe no further uninsured dental expenses.

[40]

For the same reason, I do not allow the prescription drug claim for the period pre-datingJanuary 1, 2017. The uninsured portion would have been covered had both parentsmaintained the children on their plans. The applicant should not be able to foist off hercost on the father by choosing only single coverage on her employment plan.

[41]

However, I accept the applicant’s evidence that effective January 1, 2017 the cost ofJesse’s Adderall prescriptions will not be covered at all because there is a genericalternative. It costs $244.99 monthly. Dr. Kerr is aware of this fact but continues tospecify the name brand in his prescription, presumably because the generic version is nota satisfactory alternative. There is no medical opinion evidence, but it is a reasonableinference that flows from the prescription itself.

[42]

Commencing June 1, 2017, the respondent is to reimburse the applicant for 45 percent ofthe costs she incurs for the Adderall prescription upon presentation of receipts for thecosts. His 45 percent share for the first five months of 2017 is $551.23. The cost shall beapportioned in this manner between the parties for income tax purposes.

[43]

In summary:
a) The applicant shall pay to the respondent an equalization payment of $13,031.07
b) The applicant shall pay to the respondent $15,000.00 for post-separationadjustments to the equalization paymentc) The respondent shall pay to the applicant $7,774.98 on account of s. 7 expenses todate.

Spousal Support

[44]

The parties separated more than 7 years ago after about 12 ½ years together. They havetwo sons: Kael, about to turn 16 and Jesse, who just turned 14 years of age. The boyshave been primarily in their mother’s care since the parents separated. They see theirfather regularly and frequently. They have a good relationship with both their parents.

[45]

When the parties married November 1, 1997, Ms. Heffren had completed her postsecondary school studies and was working in Windsor as a registered respiratory

-8-

therapist, the same type of work she does today. By the time Kael was born in June 2001
she had secured local employment in London and St. Thomas. Today she works two jobsand earns in excess of $100,000 annually. She is not claiming periodic spousal supportbut claims a lump sum stemming from a back injury she sustained December 29, 2009.
The parties dispute whether their separation occurred in November 2009 or January 2010,but nothing turns on that for the purposes of her spousal support claim.

[46]

In the first fifteen weeks of 2010, Ms. Heffren received short term disability equal to 100
percent of her pay, followed by a two week “waiting period” of no income, then fifteenweeks of employment insurance amounting to 40 percent of her pay. Finally she wasplaced on long term disability. At some point in 2010, she was informed by the disabilityinsurance company that she would receive $3,300 per month for “permanent disability”.
She understood from her doctor and from the insurance company that she was notexpected to ever go back to work.

[47]

Throughout 2010 the applicant underwent epidurals and other treatment to manage herexcruciating pain but no remedial treatment was offered for the injury itself. Sheultimately learned of a surgical alternative available in the United States. In the spring of2011, she underwent surgery at the Laser Spine Institute in Pennsylvania. It wasremarkably successful. She was back to full-time employment by December 2011. Thehiatus in her full-time income amounted to 20 months, from April 2010 until November2011.

[48]

The surgery in Pennsylvania cost $22,500, confirmed by Ms. Heffren’s 2011 tax return.
The tax treatment of that expense resulted in an income tax reduction for her of about
$2,500 for the year. She had other incidental expenses in relation to the surgery, whichinvolved a five-day stay in Pennsylvania, but she is only claiming $20,000 as a lump sumto reimburse her for the cost of the surgery itself. To fund this surgery, Ms. Heffrencashed in her only RRSP’s, $8,712 according to her 2011 tax return, and borrowed mostof the rest from her mother. She ultimately repaid that debt to her mother years later afterher mother passed away by adjustment with her sisters in the distribution of theirmother’s estate. She also had some assistance in defraying some part of her total costswhen her co-workers sponsored a fundraiser that raised approximately $4,000 for her.

[49]

The court’s discretion with respect to spousal support is quite broad but it must reflect thefactors and objectives spelled out in s. 15.2(4) and (6) of the Divorce Act.

[50]

In this marriage the parties both had good jobs throughout their years together. Theypooled their resources. They did not live frugally. Rather they subsidized their lifestyleby accumulating debt notwithstanding their incomes. They were each actively engaged inparenting responsibilities. They functioned as true partners financially and otherwise.
There is no evidence to justify compensatory support for the applicant’s role in themarriage. She has not sustained any economic disadvantage nor has the respondent beeneconomically advantaged by the functions or roles that they adopted.

-9-

[51]

However, the applicant has been disadvantaged by the breakdown of the marriage duringthe 23 months immediately following separation. During this period of disability fromemployment the respondent paid the mortgage and some other bills in lieu of child andspousal support. However, had the separation not occurred his income of almost $80,000
a year would no doubt have picked up the slack on other living expenses.

[52]

The applicant had an obligation to become economically self-sufficient topracticable. She certainly fulfilled that obligation. However, one objective oforder is to promote the economic self-sufficiency of a dependent spouse.
require one spouse to assist the other in achieving self-sufficiency. In this caseto have either spouse shoulder the entire cost of the wife’s remedial surgery.
reasonable to share that cost.

[53]

Between the date of separation and the interim support order 18 months later in June of2011, the respondent had been paying mortgage payments and other payments on jointdebts in lieu of child and spousal support. In 2010, his income was $78,000 and hers was
$54,000. It is implicit that the parties were content to abide by this arrangement for thefirst year or more post-separation. It would be inappropriate to rewrite history by ananalysis now of whether he paid too little or too much, even assuming I could actuallyconduct such an exercise on the disputed evidence of who paid what.

[54]

In March 2011, the respondent stopped paying. The applicant brought the motion forinterim support that resulted in the temporary order of June 2011. Payments of childsupport and in relation to the mortgage payments and other joint debts were fixed with acommencement date of June 1, 2011. The sale of the former matrimonial home in August2011 changed the underlying rationale for the order and relieved Mr. Silverthorn of hisshare of the carrying costs in the home. Ms. Heffren still had to provide accommodationfor herself and the children but now without any assistance from him at a time when shewas still disabled from employment.

[55]

In this case the length of the period of cohabitation and the ages of the applicant and thechildren at the date of separation would suggest a range for the duration of a supportorder under the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines (“SSAGs”) of 6-12 years postseparation. In the case of a disabled dependent spouse a longer term of indefinite supportmight be appropriate.

[56]

I accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that, because of the child support,the SSAGs suggest that no range of spousal support would be payable in 2011 on theincomes of the parties.

[57]

It has been observed repeatedly that the SSAG’s do not create an entitlement to spousalsupport just because they generate a suggested quantum or range. Entitlement is athreshold issue when using the SSAG’s. This case tests the other side of that coin. If theSSAG’s suggest no range of spousal support does that imply no entitlement?

the extenta supportThat mayit is unfairIt is more

- 10 -

[58]

Clearly not. For example, a spouse may have an entitlement to spousal support that ismerely postponed while child support is in play. The unusual facts in this case provideanother example. A lump sum for spousal support may be the best reflection of theobjectives and factors enumerated in s. 15 of the Divorce Act.

[59]

Lump sum support is an exception to the norm for the reasons set out in paras. 70-74 ofDavis v. Crawford, 2011 ONCA 294:

[70] As we have said, we do not endorse the submission that lump sumspousal support awards must be limited to "very unusualcircumstances" as a matter of principle. Nonetheless, we agree thatmost spousal support orders will be in the form of periodic payments.
To a large extent, this is for four very practical reasons.

[71] First, in many instances, moneys will simply not be available tofund a lump sum support award either to take the place of, or tosupplement, an award of periodic support. Instead, support will be paidfrom one spouse's income, the only available source for supportpayments, and it will be paid to finance the ongoing needs of the otherspouse, which will generally be of a periodic rather than lump sumcharacter.

[72] Second, for married couples, the court will have determinedalready the amount to be paid to equalize the value of the spouses' netfamily properties: see s. 5, Family Law Act. In many circumstances,this payment will obviate any requirements a dependent spouse mayhave for transitional capital.

[73] Third, in many cases, there will be no considerations favouring alump sum award from the perspective of either spouse.

[74] Fourth, in at least some cases where there are considerationsfavouring a lump sum award, the general exigencies of life, includingthe possibility that the parties' means and needs will change, willoutweigh the considerations favouring a lump sum award.

[60]

On one hand the applicant’s determined effort to get back into the work force simplyreflects her obligation under the Divorce Act to do all she reasonably can to be selfsupporting before turning to her spouse for help. On the other hand the efforts that sheundertook were not only extraordinary in the circumstances but potentially relieved therespondent from indefinite and long term periodic spousal support had she remainedpermanently disabled.

[61]

It is also significant, in my view, that to pay an expense of this magnitude the applicanthad to resort to her only available capital (the RRSP’s included in her net family

- 11 -

- 12 -

[62]

At paras. 66-68 of Davis v. Crawford the Court of Appeal highlighted the need to weighthe perceived advantages of a lump sum against any presenting disadvantages:

[66] Most importantly, a court considering an award of lump sumspousal support must weigh the perceived advantages of making alump sum award in the particular case against any presentingdisadvantages of making such an order.

[67] The advantages of making such an award will be highly variableand case-specific. They can include but are not limited to terminatingongoing contact or ties between the spouses for any number of reasons
(for example, short-term marriage; domestic violence; second marriagewith no children, etc.); providing capital to meet an immediate need onthe part of a dependant spouse; ensuring adequate support will be paidin circumstances where there is a real risk of non-payment of periodicsupport, a lack of proper financial disclosure or where the payor hasthe ability to pay lump sum but not periodic support; and satisfyingimmediately an award of retroactive spousal support.

[68] Similarly, the disadvantages of such an award can include the realpossibility that the means and needs of the parties will change overtime, leading to the need for a variation; the fact that the parties will beeffectively deprived of the right to apply for a variation of the lumpsum award; and the difficulties inherent in calculating an appropriateaward of lump sum spousal support where lump sum support isawarded in place of ongoing indefinite periodic support.

[63]

In this case the advantage of a lump sum is that it satisfies the applicant’s entitlement tospousal support in a manner that can be satisfied immediately in the context of theproperty issues. The amount awarded will simply be credited against the amountotherwise owing to the respondent by the applicant. Given the underlying rationale forthis spousal support order it is appropriate it not be variable. It should not be variable bythe respondent and the applicant has elected to claim this form of spousal supportknowing that it may effectively deprive her of any right to future variation or anadditional claim.

[64]

Having regard to the factors and objectives of the Divorce Act in these circumstances therespondent is ordered to pay a $12,000 lump sum to the applicant for spousal support.

property) and also had to borrow money for the cost of the surgery. She shared the aftertax value of her RRSP’s with the respondent in the net family property calculation thenhad to use those RRSP’s to relieve him of a possible future spousal support obligation.

The issues all arose in the context of a divorce proceeding. The necessary requisites havebeen met. The formal order will include the usual provision for dissolution of themarriage subject to an effective date of 31 days.
