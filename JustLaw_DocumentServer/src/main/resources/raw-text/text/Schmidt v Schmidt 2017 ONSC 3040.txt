SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE – ONTARIO
FAMILY COURT
RE:

Brenda Schmidt, ApplicantAND:
Lawrence Schmidt, Respondent

BEFORE:

TEMPLETON J.

COUNSEL: Erin Burns for the ApplicantJennifer Wall for the RespondentENDORSEMENT

[1]

The parties were divorced on March 15, 2011. The Court order (hereinafter referred to asthe “Divorce Order”) which was based on Minutes of Settlement filed by the parties,included a number of corollary provisions including but not limited to:
(a) the requirement that the Respondent pay spousal support in the amount of
$12,500 per month to the Applicant commencing March 1, 2011;
(b) the quantum payable would only be varied due to a change in the Respondent’sincome if that income exceeded $350,000 per annum or was less than $290,000 perannum for the immediately preceding taxation year;
(c) if either of the changes in the Respondent’s income occurred, the quantumpayable would increase or decrease by an amount that is 43.75% of the total by whichhis income had exceeded or fallen below $320,000 in the immediately precedingtaxation year on the 60th day following delivery of the documents required in theorder.

[2]

In April 2016, the Respondent reduced the quantum of spousal support paid every month.

[3]

The Applicant commenced garnishment proceedings in December 2016. In the Requestfor Garnishment, the Applicant seeks to enforce payment of the sum of $91,090.55 andongoing spousal support payments of $12,500 per month. The Applicant has based hercalculation on the Divorce Order requiring the Respondent to pay her $12,500 per month.

CITATION: Schmidt v. Schmidt, 2017 ONSC 3040
COURT FILE NO.: F1363/09
DATE: May 16, 2017

[4]

The Request for Garnishment which was issued on October 20, 2016 is directed to thefollowing Garnishees:

(b) the Royal Bank of Canada in London;
(c) the Bank of Montreal in London; and
(d) the Advanced Medical Group in London.

[5]

The Request declares that the Garnishee owes or will owe to the Payor (the Respondent)
periodic amounts of $12,500 and a lump sum of $91,090.50. Under “description of debtowed by the Garnishee to the Payor”, the Applicant has indicated “money held at a bank,credit union etc.” or “wages, commissions or other employment income” as the case maybe.

[6]

The Respondent has filed a Dispute and requested a Garnishment Hearing.

[7]

At the hearing, I requested written submissions. Counsel have complied.
The Evidence

[8]

Until December 31, 2015, the Respondent, who is a family physician, was employed in aFamily Health Organization which was paid by the Ontario Health Insurance Program ona capitation model. He also held an appointment at Western University.

[9]

Effective January 1, 2016, the Respondent left his practice for health-related reasons andstarted working with the Advanced Medical Group on March 1, 2016. He coveredanother physician’s practice in the interim. He is paid on a fee-for-service basis by OHIP.
His income will be lower than in past years.

[10]

The Respondent has filed his Income Tax Returns for the time period in question.

[11]

According to these Tax Returns, the Respondent’s Line 150 total income from all sourceshas been as follows:
(a) 2011: $496,123.89
(b) 2012: $302,470.56
(c) 2013: $313,020.56
(d) 2014: $298,637.81
(e) 2015: $312,447.07

(a) the CIBC in London;

The parties agree that for support purposes, the Respondent’s income should becalculated as the sum of his pre-tax corporate income and his employment and otherincome. As the Respondent indicates, “This accounts for the Respondent’s ability toretain earnings in his professional corporation.”

[13]

On the other hand, as the Applicant points out, this formula may be more favourable tothe Respondent (as it was in 2012) as opposed to using his Line 150 income as the basisfor the calculation of the quantum payable for the following year.

[14]

The parties agree, therefore, that for support purposes, using the sum of the Respondent’spre-tax corporate income and his employment and other income, his income for each ofthe following years was as follows:
(a) 2011: $395,430.90
(b) 2012: $340,322.56
(c) 2013: $335,178.56
(d) 2014: $303,517.81

[15]

[16]

The parties differ with respect to the Respondent’s income for 2015:
2015:

$314,924.07 (according to the Applicant)

2015:

$281,884.07 (according to the Respondent)

The difference in the alleged income for 2015 is based on the Applicant’s inclusion andthe Respondent’s exclusion of $33,040.00 which the Applicant has characterized as
“taxable dividends”.
The Position of the Parties
(a) The Applicant

[17]

The order is clear with respect to how spousal support is to be calculated.

[18]

Whether the Respondent’s Line 150 income is used to determine support or whether theRespondent’s employment income plus pre-tax corporate income is used, the Respondentis in arrears of spousal support for the year 2012 (plus interest) and from April 2016 tothe end of the year 2016.

[19]

The Respondent is not permitted to unilaterally reduce his spousal support payments. Hemust continue to pay spousal support in accordance with the Order unless and untilspousal support is varied by a further Court order or agreement.

[12]

The Respondent is taking the position that the garnishment has caused him significanthardship but fails to acknowledge his role in the generation of that hardship or the impactof his unilateral reduction on the Applicant.

[21]

There is nothing in the Family Law Rules, O. Reg. 114/99 that precludes the enforcementof payment of spousal support arrears by way of garnishment.

(b) The Respondent

[22]

The Respondent acknowledges that he is in arrears for spousal support in the amount of
$33,001.06 for the year 2012 (based on his income for 2011) and that this is the totalamount of arrears owing for the time period between January 1, 2012 and December 31,2016.

[23]

The Respondent also submits that since the Applicant has had the benefit of an increasein the Respondent’s pre-tax corporate income, she should also share in the impact ofcorporate loss in his income particularly when draws on retained earnings are needed tomaintain payment of support to the Applicant.

[24]

Further, a change in the quantum of spousal support payable does not require anamending agreement or a Court Order. The provisions and mechanism for a change to thequantum payable are included in the Divorce Order.

[25]

It is also the Respondent’s position that the garnishment process has caused significanthardship to the Respondent and his wife. Their joint bank account has been garnished, asa result of which preauthorized payments have been rejected. He is paying fees foraccounts that are empty by reason of the garnishment but he is unable to close.

[26]

Garnishment is only appropriate when an obligation is certain. In this case, the quantumof the obligation varies from year to year. The garnishee has no way of knowing whethera variation is necessary. Even if the garnishee is provided with the income information, itis inappropriate to delegate to the garnishee the authority to crystallize the supportobligation.
Analysis

[27]

In my view, both parties have acted precipitously and must bear responsibility for thepredicament in which they now find themselves.

[28]

Firstly, the Respondent ought not to have unilaterally reduced the quantum of spousalsupport he was paying.

[29]

The Minutes of Settlement on which the Divorce Order was based clearly provides thatthe quantum of spousal support payable on a go forward monthly basis is fixed on thebasis of the Respondent’s income for the prior calendar, not the current calendar year.

[20]

[30]

The drawback to this methodology, of course, is that on the one hand, when there is anincome increase during the current year, the support recipient will not derive animmediate benefit from that increase and will have to wait until the next calendar year;and, on the other, when there is an income decrease during the current year, the supportpayor will not derive an immediate benefit from the decrease and will have to wait untilthe next calendar year for the adjustment.

[31]

Such was the case here. In compliance with the Divorce Order, the impact on spousalsupport of the decrease in the Respondent’s income in 2016 ought not to have takeneffect until 2017.

[32]

I also disagree with the Applicant, however, that an adjustment to the quantum of spousalsupport payable by the Respondent requires an amending agreement or a Court Order. Ifthis were the case, the provisions of paragraph 11 of the Divorce Order regarding thetiming, the percentage and calculation of a variation of the spousal support payable wouldbe of entirely no consequence. These are provisions that are extraordinary and unique tothese parties. In my view, the intent of these provisions is precisely to allow the partiesthe mechanism and opportunity to avoid further costly litigation and resort to the judicialsystem for resolution.

[33]

I turn now to the question of whether garnishment proceedings are available to theApplicant in these circumstances.

[34]

In this regard, first consideration must be given to the Divorce Order.

[35]

Paragraph 20 of that Order provides as follows:
THIS COURT ORDERS that unless the support order is withdrawn from theoffice of the Director of the Family Responsibility Office, it shall be enforcedby the Director and amounts owing under the support order shall be paid tothe Director, who shall pay them to the person to whom they are owed.

[36]

Notwithstanding this specific provision in the Divorce Order to which the parties agreed,subsection 9 (1) of the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act,19661 (“FRSAEA”) states:
Every support order made by an Ontario court, other than a provisional order,shall state in its operative part that unless the order is withdrawn from theDirector’s office, it shall be enforced by the Director and that amounts owingunder the order shall be paid to the Director, who shall pay them to theperson to whom they are owed.

1

S.O. 1966, c. 31, as am.

The benefit of this approach is the security and predictability afforded to both parties asto how much is to be paid for the 12 months following the determination of the prioryear’s income.

[37]

Subsection 10 (1) of the FRSAEA provides:

[38]

Subsection 10 (2) reads:
When a support order is changed and the changed order is a support order asdefined in subsection 1(1), the court shall also make a support deductionorder to reflect the change.

[39]

There is no doubt that the order for the payment of support in this Divorce Order is a
“support order” as defined in the FRSAEA.

[40]

Section 11 of the FRSAEA requires the Court to file the support deduction order with theDirector’s office.

[41]

Section 16 of the FRSAEA allows a support order to be withdrawn or a support deductionorder filed in the office of the Director to be withdrawn at any time unless the supportorder states that it and the related support deduction order cannot be withdrawn from theDirector’s office.

[42]

Section 4 of the FRSAEA concerns Assignment of the Director’s powers. Those powersare defined in section 6 and include enforcing support deduction orders that are filed inthe Director’s office, as provided by the Act, employing any other enforcementmechanisms expressly provided for in the Act and employing any other enforcementmechanisms not expressly provided for in the Act.

[43]

There is no evidence before me that the parties withdrew their support order or theenforcement thereof from the office of the Director pursuant to section 16 or that theDirector assigned his powers to anyone else including either of the parties (if that werepossible) pursuant to section 4.

[44]

In these circumstances, the provision in subsection 6 (7) of the FRSAEA takes onsubstantial significance. That subsection states:
Subject to section 4, no person other than the Director shall enforce a supportorder that is filed in the Director’s office.

[45]

The difficulty is that, in this case, I have not been provided with proof that the Courtcomplied with its duty to prepare a Support Deduction Order that complied with thesupport provisions included in the Divorce Order.

[46]

In the file, there are Support Deduction Orders for the interim support orders but I havebeen unable to locate such an order in relation to the final consent order regardingspousal support.

An Ontario court that makes a support order, as defined in subsection 1(1),shall also make a support deduction order.

In any event, given the mandatory nature of subsection 9 (1) of the FRSAEA, when readin conjunction with subsection 6 (7) of the FRSAEA, concerning the jurisdiction toenforce a support order in the absence of a refusal by the Director to do so or awithdrawal by the parties, I am of the view that Garnishment proceedings are notavailable to the Applicant in this case.

[48]

The Family Law Rules do not oust the provisions of the legislation in this regard.

[49]

The Court must take immediate steps to ensure that a Support Deduction Order isprepared and signed on the basis of the Divorce Order and that subsequent SupportDeduction Orders are prepared and signed that accord with the quantum of supportpayable as agreed by counsel for the time period between January 1, 2012 to December31, 2016, as set out above.

[50]

It will be for counsel to draft an order that reflects the changes necessary upon which theCourt staff may rely.

[51]

With respect to the determination of the Respondent’s income for 2016, I am of the viewthat the methodology agreed upon by the parties at the outset and upon which they haveboth relied must continue to ensure an equitable outcome for both of them.

[52]

In the past, as indicated above, the Respondent’s income has been determined by addingup his pre-tax corporate income and his employment and other income. The dividends hereceived as reported on Line 120 of his Tax Return did not form part of the incomedetermination for spousal support purposes taking into account the issue of retainedearnings.

[53]

Using the same categories in relation to his income in 2015 as previously relied upon, theRespondent therefore generated $278,345.56 (Line 101) in employment income, $1000 inprofessional income and $2477 in corporate income before taxes as well as interestetcetera. His income for 2015 should be fixed at $281,884.07.

[54]

Should either of the parties seek to change aspects of the terms of the Divorce Orderconcerning the formula to be used for determining the Respondent’s income, and theformula to be used for the calculation of ongoing monthly spousal, they are required toserve and file a motion to change this order.

[55]

My disposition includes orders that were not sought by either party. In my view, theseorders are necessary for the Court to be able to control its own process both effectivelyand efficiently.
Disposition

[56]

For all of these reasons, the following is my order:
(a) The Applicant’s Garnishment proceeding is hereby terminated.

[47]

(c) The parties will prepare a Support Deduction Order that reflects the DivorceOrder of Justice Marshman dated March 15, 2011 and,
(i) ensure that the Court files the said Order with the Director of the FamilyResponsibility Office; and
(ii) ensure that all payments made by the Respondent between March 15, 2011
and December 31, 2015 are communicated to the Director.
(d) The parties will prepare a Support Deduction Order that reflects the requirementthat the Respondent pay monthly spousal support for the year 2016 afterapplication of the prescribed formula set out in the Divorce Order to an income of
$281,884.07 for the year 2015. Further, the parties will file that SupportDeduction Order with the Court and ensure that it is filed with the Director of theFamily Responsibility Office for enforcement.
(e) The parties will prepare a Support Deduction Order that reflects the requirementthat the Respondent pay monthly spousal support for the year 2017 afterapplication of the prescribed formula set out in the Divorce Order to an incomefixed for the year 2016 on the basis of the formula set out above and used by theparties since 2011. Further, the parties will file that Support Deduction Order withthe Court and ensure that it is filed with the Director of the Family ResponsibilityOffice for enforcement.
(f) Should the Director require a Court Order reflecting the changes, if any, to thequantum of monthly support payable, the parties will obtain a consent order andfile a copy of same with the Director in the absence of a Court Order that changesthe methodology and basis of calculation or any other aspect of the support ordercontained in the Divorce Order dated March 15, 2011.
(g) Unless the parties wish to make submissions to convince me otherwise, it is myview that each party ought to bear his or her own costs in this proceeding byreason of his/her own liability (as described at the outset of these Reasons) for thenecessity of this Court’s intervention.
