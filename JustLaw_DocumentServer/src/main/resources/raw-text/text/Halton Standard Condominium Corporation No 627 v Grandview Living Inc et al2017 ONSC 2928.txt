COSTS RULING

[1]
On April 12, 2017 I released my reasons for judgment in this application. The applicantwas successful: I ordered the arbitration agreement and arbitration award to be enforceableagainst the Grandview respondents. Blaney was unsuccessful in opposing the application on thebasis it had a valid solicitors’ charging order over certain property that was to be transferredunder the arbitration agreement and award.

[2]
The parties were unable to agree upon costs. I have received costs submissions from theapplicant and from the respondent, Blaney. I received no submissions from the Grandviewrespondents.

[3]
The applicant seeks its costs of the application to enforce the terms of the arbitrationagreement, awarding a costs decision in the amount of $7,516.70 on a full indemnity scale or

[4]
The applicant was successful on the application. It is entitled to its costs with respect toenforcing the terms of the arbitration agreement, award and costs decision as against theGrandview respondents. The costs were incurred because Grandview failed to comply with theterms of the agreement and award. The Grandview respondents shall pay to the applicant itscosts on a partial indemnity basis fixed in the amount of $5,400.00, inclusive of HST anddisbursements.

[5]
With respect to the solicitors’ charging order, the Condominium Corporation wassuccessful and the charging order was set aside to allow for a transfer in accordance with thearbitration agreement. Blaney submits that there should be no order as to costs against it becausethe applicant had some notice of the charging orders and the applicant ought not to haveexpected that Grandview would honour its obligations under the arbitration agreement or awardvoluntarily. In addition, Blaney was caught in the middle of the dispute and its motion wasreasonable and appropriate in light of Grandview’s failure to pay the fees.

[6]
While it was the failure of Grandview to pay the fees owed to Blaney that led it to opposethe application and it was Blaney that took those steps, Blaney was unsuccessful. The applicantwas successful. In the normal course, an unsuccessful party is required to pay the costs of thesuccessful party. There is no reason to depart from this general principle in this case. Therefore,Blaney is liable to the applicant for the costs associated with the charging order.

[7]
I have reviewed the bill of costs associated with the charging order. Blaney made nosubmissions with respect to the quantum of the costs. I find their costs to be reasonable. There isno reason to depart from the general rule that costs should be awarded on a partial indemnitybasis. I order that Blaney pay to the applicant its costs associated with the charging orders fixedin the amount of $26,000.00, inclusive of HST and disbursements.
