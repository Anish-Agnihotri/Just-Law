Hitachi, Autoliv and Leoni – Settlement Approvals and Related Motions

BEFORE:

- Page 3 -

The 35 or so auto-parts price-fixing class actions that I am continuing to casemanage have started to settle, or at least settle with certain defendants involving certainauto-parts. I have already approved several such settlements.1

[1]

In cases where counsel ask that the action be certified for settlement purposes, I
do so readily because all of these auto-parts actions follow the same template and easilysatisfy the requirements in s. 5 of the Class Proceedings Act 2 (“CPA”). In cases wheresettlement approval alone is the issue, I generally focus on whether the settlement amountfalls within a zone of reasonableness. Class counsel now understands what evidence isrequired in these auto-part cases and they file the appropriate affidavits – about parallelsettlements in the U.S., and fines imposed and sales in Canada. In short, both here and inthe cases still coming, I expect that settlement approval will be the norm.
Here the plaintiffs move for judicial approval under s. 29(2) of the CPA for thefollowing settlements:

[3]

(i)

the Hitachi defendants in the ten actions listed below have agreed topay CDN$6,667,084 for the benefit of the settlement classesallocated as follows:
Air Flow Meters

$725,000

Alternators

$950,000

Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c.6.

[2]

(ii)

the Autoliv defendants in the Occupant Safety Systems action haveagreed to pay US$3.2 million for the benefit of the settlement class;and,

(iii)

the Leoni defendants in the Automotive Wire Harness Systemsaction have agreed to pay CDN$250,000 for the benefit of thesettlement class.

Consent certification for settlement purposes

[4]
The plaintiffs also seek certification, for settlement purposes only, of the OntarioOccupant Safety Systems action as against Autoliv and the Ontario Automotive WireHarness Systems action as against Leoni. The actions in which Hitachi is the settlingdefendant were certified for settlement purposes as against Hitachi at the same time asnotice approval. I note that that proposed class and common issues are substantively thesame as those previously certified. I also note that the proposed representative plaintiffswere previously appointed as representative plaintiffs.

[5]
Certification for settlement purposes as against Autoliv in the Occupant SafetySystems action and as against Leoni in the Automotive Wire Harness Systems action iseasily granted.
Settlement approvals

[6]

I will consider the Hitachi, Autoliv and Leoni settlements in turn.
(1) Hitachi

[7]
Hitachi has agreed to pay CDN$6,667,084 as allocated in the chart above andprovide substantial cooperation in the ongoing litigation.

[8]
I am satisfied that this settlement falls within a zone of reasonableness for thefollowing reasons. The amount of the U.S. settlement was $61.5 million – the Canadiansettlement falls within the one-tenth rule of thumb. Further, there were no directCanadian sales. This point is supported by the fact that Hitachi has not been the subject ofany fines or penalties by the Competition Bureau. The settlement was therefore valuedbased on Hitachi’s indirect sales into Canada and its commitment to provide what classcounsel describes as “meaningful cooperation, particularly with regard to the ringleadersof the various conspiracies in several of the relevant actions” and the provision ofconfidential evidentiary proffers to this end.

[9]

The Hitachi settlements are approved.

[10] Autoliv has agreed to pay US$3.2 million or CDN$4,172,800 and providesubstantial cooperation in the ongoing litigation.

[11] I am satisfied that the settlement falls within a zone of reasonableness for thefollowing reasons. No fines or penalties were paid to Canadian regulators. The amount ofAutoliv’s settlements in the U.S. Occupant Safety Systems litigation was US$65 million,about US$25 million of which was allocated to indirect purchasers. I agree with classcounsel that this case is comparable to the U.S. indirect purchasers situation becauseAutoliv’s only direct purchaser in Canada has opted out of the action. The Autolivsettlement amount is 12.8% of the U.S. indirect settlement amount and 8.6% of theestimated affected commerce – placing the amount generally within the one-tenth rule ofthumb.

[12]

The Autoliv settlement is approved.
(3) Leoni

[13] Leoni has agreed to pay CDN$250,000 and provide substantial cooperation in theongoing litigation. The amount of Leoni’s settlements in the U.S. litigation was US$1.95
million – the Canadian settlement therefore falls within the one-tenth rule of thumb. Also,Leoni has not been the subject of any fines or penalties by the Competition Bureau mostlikely because Leoni’s alleged involvement in the Automotive Wire Harness Systemsconspiracy only affected the Renault II, which was never sold in Canada.

[14]

The Leoni settlements are approved.

Legal fees approvalBy agreement amongst counsel, 7.2% of the Autoliv, Hitachi and Leoni settlementamounts are notionally allocated to the Quebec classes for the purpose of the feeapplications in that province. The remaining Autoliv, Hitachi and Leoni settlementamounts are notionally allocated to the Ontario and B.C. classes for the purpose of the feeapplications in those provinces. In accordance with the retainer agreements entered intowith the Ontario representative plaintiffs, Ontario and B.C. Class Counsel are seeking afee of 25% of the amount notionally allocated to the Ontario and B.C. classes.

[15]

As I explained in Cannon 3 and again in Middlemiss v. Penn West Petroleum,4 I amprepared to accord presumptive validity to a properly executed contingency feearrangement such as the one that is before me. It is only through a robust contingencycompensation system that class counsel will be appropriately rewarded for the wins andlosses over many files and many years of litigation and that the class action will continueto remain viable as a meaningful vehicle for access to justice. 5 (The point about “winsand losses” is clearly illustrated by comparing class counsel’s docketed time with the feesthat will be recovered in the Automotive Wire Harness Systems action in the chartbelow.)

[17] The chart summarizes the legal fees request, the docketed time and thedisbursements:

Ibid., at para. 19. Also see Ramdath v. George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology, 2016 ONSC 3536,at note 14: “Over a period of years, plaintiff-side class action firms will win cases and lose cases. The “risk” thatcontingency lawyers face cannot be assessed case-by-case or one-off, but must be measured across a great manyfiles. A “large” contingency recovery in one case will offset the loss or losses in other cases. That is why the
“multiplier” approach that purports to assess risk by considering only the case that is curren tly before the court isfundamentally flawed, indeed unprincipled.”

HonorariaThe representative plaintiffs in the Automotive Wire Harness Systems action havebeen actively involved both in that litigation and the auto parts cases as a whole. I agreewith class counsel that the payment of a $2500 honorarium to each representativeplaintiff in the Automotive Wire Harness Systems action is warranted.
