Background

[1]

This proceeding was heard as a Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of liability in

a dispute between related parties and their long-time solicitor who provided legal services for thecreation of a family trust. My Endorsement dated January 3, 2017 granted partial summary

ONTARIO

judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs on the issue of liability and as such, the Plaintiffs are entitledto the payment of their costs related to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The matter

result of the Defendants’ proposed manner to resolve the issue of causality.

[2]

Each of the parties have provided their written costs submissions and I have considered

them in deciding the matter.

[3]

The Plaintiffs claim partial indemnity costs to the date of their Offer to Settle being

January 16, 2016 ($42,951.30) and then substantial indemnity costs thereafter ($178,467.57
together with disbursements of $176,464.54). The total amounts claimed by the Plaintiffs are
$221,418.87 in fees and $176,464.54 in disbursements.

[4]

The Defendants submits that a global award of $150,000.00 is appropriate in the

circumstances.

In coming to this amount, the Defendants rely on their Partial Indemnity Bill of

Costs which amounts to $154,372.78 of which $62,719.78 relates to disbursements.

[5]

The Third Party claims partial indemnity costs in the amount of $19,566.96 from the

Defendants.

The Defendants have confirmed that they have resolved the claim for costs by the

Third Party.
Analysis

[6]

I have considered the following principles in my decision to award costs to Plaintiffs:


The Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, C. C.43 (“CJA”) provides:
131(1) Subject to the provisions of an Act or rules of court, the costs ofand incidental to a proceeding or a step in a proceeding are in thediscretion of the court, and the court may determine by whom and to whatextent the costs shall be paid.



assessments. Armstrong J.A. stated: “When the court awards costs, it shall fix them inaccordance with sub-rule 57.01(1) and the Tariffs…Subrule (1) lists a broad range of

131 of the CJA.” Further, the Court of Appeal in Boucher stated that the assessment of

reasonable for the unsuccessful party to pay in the particular circumstances of the case,rather than an amount fixed by the actual costs incurred by the successful litigant: seeBoucher at para 26).

[7]

In exercising my discretion to award costs in these proceedings, I have considered the

factors set out in Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 and makethe following findings:
1. Offer to Settle: The Plaintiffs made an offer to settle in January 2016. That offerre-stated the relief requested in the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. TheDefendants suggest that the Court did not grant the relief sought in paragraph 1(c)
of the Notice of Motion. I agree with the Plaintiffs that paragraph 1(c) sought anadmission on the issue of causation. While my decision did not expressly addresspara 1(c), the effect of the decision is to arrive at a conclusion on the issue ofcausality and as such the Plaintiffs obtained a result which is equal to that whichwas offered in the Offer to Settle. It must be noted that the Plaintiff’s offer is a
“no-cost” offer as it re-states the relief sought in the Notice of Motion. Such anoffer does not in my view automatically trigger the cost consequences of Rule 49:2. Costs of the Unsuccessful Party: The Defendants have submitted a Bill of Costswhich can be considered when determining the amount that the unsuccessful partycould reasonably expect to pay.

Here, the Defendant’s show partial indemnity

fees of $91,653 and disbursements of $62,719.78.

While this amount is

significantly lower than the amounts claimed by the Plaintiffs, the Defendant’ssubstantial indemnity Bill of Costs is $124,981 in fees and $62,719.78 indisbursements.

costs is not a mechanical issue. The overall objective is to fix an amount that is fair and

3. Time Spent: The time spent by the Plaintiffs was challenged by the Defendants.
The Defendants also challenge the Plaintiffs inclusion of fees related to issues

the time related to the disclosure motion are recoverable at this stage, I disagree.
These are costs which form part of the litigation as a whole and do not relatespecifically to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. I agree with theDefendants that several items for which costs are claimed relate to matters whichare outside the scope of the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and that areduction in the amount claimed is warranted.
4. Importance of the Issues: The issues were obviously important to the parties. Theissues surrounding a potential deemed disposition involving over two milliondollars of taxes was clearly very important.
5. Complexity: This was obviously a very complex matter. It required that experts intaxation law be retained and they provided detailed reports to address the issues.
Furthermore, the Defendant’s Bill of Costs demonstrates the extent to which thiswas a complicated litigation which required significant work by senior counseldespite the fact that the Defendants were not the party driving the issuessurrounding the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. It would be expected thatthe Plaintiffs’ fees would be higher than those of the Defendants.
6. Conduct: The conduct of the parties has been considered herein. The Plaintiffsadvance that the Defendants acted unreasonably in delaying the admission on theissue of liability.

I disagree. This was a complex litigation and the Defendants

have defended it in a reasonable manner which is reflective of its importance andcomplexity. The Defendants conducted themselves properly in the litigation andwhile the duration of the litigation clearly has increased the Plaintiffs’ claim forcosts, it does not give rise to a finding that the Defendants acted unreasonably.

[8]

In the end, I agree with the Defendants that the costs claimed by the Plaintiffs are higher

than that which was required for a motion of this nature.

While I recognize that the Plaintiffs

beyond the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. While the Plaintiffs claim that

were driving the litigation and in these circumstances would be expected to have incurred morefees than the Defendants, I am of the view that the total time spent is excessive. The Plaintiffs

There are issues of proportionality which apply to both the time spent and the disbursementsclaimed.

[9]

When considering the Plaintiffs’ Bill of Costs, there are several items for which time is

claimed that pre-date the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and are not directly associatedto it. These costs can be claimed in the context of the litigation as a whole but not specificallyfor the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.

Specifically, I disallow at this point the time

spent titled “legal fees incurred prior to the service of the summary judgment motion” togetherwith the fees related to the Request to admit and the Disclosure Motion. The entries amount to
$17,061.54.

[10]

I am also concerned with the time spent of preparing the costs submissions. The Plaintiffs

claim $21,525.31 while the Defendants have time spent of just under $6,000.00.

I find the

Plaintiff’s claim for costs related to the costs submissions excessive.

[11]

Finally, when considering the time spent on the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, I

note that in 2016, Plaintiffs’ senior counsel spent 137.2 hours in time, the main junior counselspent 190.1 hours and students spent 141.3 hours. Conversely, in 2016, the Defendants’ seniorcounsel spent 190.5 hours, junior counsel 58.13 and a law clerk spent 20.70 hours.

While I

acknowledge that the bulk of the time spent by the Plaintiffs related to junior counsel, the totalamount of time spent exceeds a fair amount and that which would reasonably be expected to berequired in the circumstances.

[12]

As set out in Boucher, the exercise here is not a mechanical calculation of the amounts

claimed but more appropriately an analysis of what is fair. I therefore conclude that prior to theJanuary 15, 2016 Offer to settle, the Plaintiffs are entitled to partial indemnity costs fixed at
$25,889.76. Following the Offer to settle, I note that the Defendant’s substantial indemnity Billof Costs is roughly $100,000. I am of the view that a fair amount for the Plaintiffs’ would besomewhere between the partial indemnity and substantial indemnity rates.

I therefore fix the

amount of costs after the Offer to Settle at $125,000, inclusive of taxes. Finally, for the costssubmissions, I fix the Plaintiffs’ costs at $10,000.
With respect to disbursements, my issue is with proportionality. While I appreciate that

the experts retained provided detailed reports in support of their opinions and that they werecross-examined, the amounts claimed are out of proportion with the amounts spent by theDefendants to address similar issues. I fix the Plaintiffs’ disbursements at $100,000.
Conclusion

[14]

For the reasons provided, I conclude that the Plaintiff’s are entitled to an award of costs

against the Defendants arising from the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of $160,889.76 infees (inclusive of taxes) and $100,000 in disbursements (inclusive of taxes).
