RE:

Krystal McLeish, PlaintiffAND
Erin Daines and Paul Penney, Defendants

BEFORE:

Mr. Justice Robert J. Smith

COUNSEL: Alan J. Clausi, Counsel for the PlaintiffKevin P. Nearing, Counsel for DefendantsHEARD:

In writingDECISION ON COSTS

[1]

The Plaintiff claims fees on a partial indemnity basis of $155,354.10 plus HST, plus

disbursements of $100,260.41 inclusive of HST for a 15-day civil jury trial. The Plaintiffrecovered $65,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages and $175,000 for future pecuniary damages fora total of $240,000.00 but was found 30% contributarily negligent. This reduced her recovery to
$168,000.00 plus costs and interest less the deductible.

[2]

The Defendant submits that it was partially successful on liability as the Plaintiff was

found 30% responsible and was partly successful on her claim for loss of future income whichwas assessed at $175,000.00 when the Plaintiff sought $850,000.00.

[3]

The Defendant further submits that the Plaintiff spent an excessive amount of time

preparing for discoveries, mediation and for trial and had two senior counsel at trial rather than asenior counsel assisted by a junior counsel.

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO

[4]

The Defendant also objects to paying the travel disbursements for out of town counsel,

[5]

The Defendant finally objects to paying the disbursements for witnesses that were not

called to testify at trial, including Dr. Fedak-Tarmopolsky for $5,243.70, Dr. Lewis for $4,350,Dr. Tester for $270, and two supplementary reports prepared by ADS, for a total reduction of
$14,723.70.

[6]

The Defendant also seeks to exclude the disbursements for Dr. Friedlander and Dr.

Holland as they allege their evidence was of marginal value. I do not agree with this submissionas they were permitted to testify in different areas.

[7]

The Defendant submits that $120,000.00 for fees and $55,000.00 for disbursements,

inclusive of HST, is a reasonable amount to be awarded to the Plaintiff for her costs.
Factors

[8]

The factors to be considered when fixing costs are set out in Rule 57 of the

Rules of Civil Procedure and include in addition to success, the amount claimed and recovered,the complexity and importance of the matter and the principle of proportionality, the conduct ofany party which unduly lengthened the proceeding, whether any step was improper, vexatious orunnecessary, or taken through negligence mistake or excessive caution, a party’s denial orrefusal to admit anything, any offer to settle, the principle of indemnity, scale of costs, hourlyrate claimed in relation to the partial indemnity rate set out in the Information to the Professioneffective July 1, 2005, the time spent, and the amount that a losing party would reasonablyexpect to pay.

which results in a reduction of $6,138.

SuccessThe Defendant submits that it was partially successful on liability as the Plaintiff was

found 30% responsible and was partly successful on the loss of future income which wasassessed at $175,000.00 when the Plaintiff has sought $850,000.00.

[10]

The Plaintiff recovered $168,000.00 plus costs and interest after her share of

responsibility was deducted. She was successful although she recovered less than she sought attrial.
Amount Claimed and Recovered

[11]

The Plaintiff sought $850,000.00 in loss of future income and recovered only

$175,000.00. The Plaintiff was not fully successful on the amount she recovered.
Complexity and Importance

[12]

The issues were reasonably complex as they involved assessing contributory negligence

when turning left on a yellow or red light. In addition the case involved chronic pain and the lossof future income. The case was a typical motor vehicle accident jury trial and was important tothe parties involved.
Offers to Settle

[13]

The Plaintiff did not exceed any offers to settle but did come very close as she offered to

settle for $170,000.00 plus costs and P.J.I, but only recovered $168,000.00 plus costs and P.J.I.
In Elbakhiat v Palmer, 2014 ONCA 544, the Court of Appeal held that there was no “near miss”

[9]

doctrine but did consider the effect of the Defendant’s offer to settle under Rule 49.13 of Rules of

[14]

The Defendant offered to settle for $5,000.00 and then increased this amount to

$35,000.00 plus costs and interest nineteen days before the trial. The Defendant’s offers werenot close to the amount recovered.

[15]

As the Plaintiff did not exceed her offer to settle after trial and the conduct of the

Defendant was not egregious or reprehensible, costs will be assessed on a partial indemnityscale.
Hourly Rates and Time Spent

[16]

The Defendant submits that an excessive amount of time was spent in preparation for

trial. The Plaintiff was required to spend more time in preparation for this case than theDefendants. Mr. Clausi was the senior lawyer that had carriage of the action for 26 months priorto trial and had conducted all aspects of the case until shortly before trial. As such, it wasreasonable that he participate in the trial involving many expert witnesses that he had retained.
However, I will reduce the amount of costs awarded for using two senior counsel at trial ratherthan a senior counsel and a junior counsel.
Experts not called at Trial

[17]

Dr. Fedak-Tamopolsky, a licensed physiatrist, prepared an expert report and an

addendum for which the Plaintiff has paid $5,220 and $704.78 for her reports. Several monthsbefore trial, she advised the Plaintiff that she was retiring and would not be available to testify at

Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.

trial, after the notice of trial was served on her. I agree with the Plaintiff that these expenses areunfortunate but the Plaintiff acted reasonably in retaining her as a properly qualified expert and

[18]

I agree with the Defendant that disbursements incurred for Dr. Lewis, Dr. Tester, Dr.

Woolbeck, Candis Dodd, Catherin Merritt and Christine Gload who did not testify at trial willnot be allowed. I will deduct the sum of $5,499.77 from the disbursements claimed for theseexperts and witnesses who were not called at trial.
Out of Town Counsel Travel Expenses

[19]

The Defendants object to payment for the travel and lodging expenses for counsel from

the Oshawa area to attend the Trial in Ottawa when the plaintiff had already retained counselfrom Ottawa. The Plaintiff was living in Barrie for some time prior to trial and had the right tocounsel of her choice. If she is unable to claim for Mr. Mair’s travel and lodging expense thenshe would be penalized financially for retaining Mr. Mair to conduct the trial because he did notlive in the Ottawa area. If she had been unsuccessful at trial, then she would have had to pay thereasonable costs for the out of town counsel to attend. Mr. Mair was an experienced counsel whoalong with defence counsel cooperated and ran a very efficient trial. His involvement in this trialwas reasonable but in the circumstances where the plaintiff had already retained counsel fromOttawa, I will allow one half of Mr. Mair’s travel and lodging expenses as a disbursement.

her unavailability to testify at trial was not the Plaintiff’s fault.

Expectations of Unsuccessful Party

[20]

I find that the amount claimed for costs, is in the range of what the unsuccessful

Defendant would reasonably expect to pay, based on the number of experts involved in a chronicpain three week jury trial.

Disposition

[21]

Having considered the relevant factors and for the above reasons, the Defendants are

ordered to pay costs on a partial indemnity basis of $145,000.00 plus HST, plus disbursements of
$85,000.000 inclusive of HST.
