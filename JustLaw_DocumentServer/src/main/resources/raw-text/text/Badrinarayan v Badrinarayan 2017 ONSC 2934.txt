[1]

Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan married on August 25, 1985. They separated on August 4,

2011 and divorced on August 17, 2012. Their union was of 26 years, to date of separation. Theyhad four children: Andrew, DOB July 25, 1985, Matthew DOB May 23, 1986, Tristan DOB June7, 1988, and Nicholas DOB March 13, 1992. At the time of their separation, all of the childrenwere independent.

CITATION: Badrinarayan v. Badrinarayan, 2017 ONSC 2934
COURT FILE NO.: FS-14-4203-00
DATE: 2017 05 12

-2-

[2]

This motion was originally brought by Mrs. Badrinarayan as a motion for interim support

and equalization of net family property.

Justice LeMay, by endorsement dated 25 November,

2016, ordered that the question of spousal support proceed to a two-day trial in which theaffidavits filed in respect of the motion would constitute the parties’ examinations in chief, andonly cross examination would be conducted at trial.

[3]

Initially, Mrs. Badrinarayan took the position that the motion was for interim support.

However, after reviewing Justice LeMay, J.’s endorsement and the final order, she conceded thatthe motion was for a final order respect to spousal support. The application, however, wouldcontinue with respect to equalization of net family property.
Procedural history

[4]

The unwinding of this couple’s relationship has moved at a snail’s pace. As indicated,

they separated on August 4, 2011. On December 15, 2011, the husband filed for a simpledivorce. It was granted, unopposed, on August 17, 2012, notwithstanding that Mrs. B. was awareof the application at least by December 26, 2011.

[5]

The jointly-owned matrimonial home was sold on June 22, 2012, with the proceeds of the

sale being split between the parties, with each receiving approximately $230,000. It is of notethat between the date of separation of August 4, 2011 and the sale of the property on June 22,2012, Mr. Badrinarayan had finished paying off the mortgage.

[6]

In July, 2013, Mrs. Badrinarayan’ s lawyer wrote to Mr. Badrinarayan demanding that he

pay spousal support and enter discussions about equalization of net family property. Mr.Badrinarayan did not respond to this. At trial he gave two explanations for this. At one point hesaid that he merely waited for Mrs. Badrinarayan to say what she wanted. At another point he

said that he thought the two spouses had reached an oral agreement that all property and support

[7]

The matter went dormant again until September 12, 2014 when Mrs. Badrinarayan

commenced her application. On October 10, 2014, Mr. Badrinarayan filed his answer.

[8]

The matter went dormant again until September 26, 2016 when Mrs. Badrinarayan

requested a case conference. The case conference was held before Donohue, J, on June 14, 2016.
She gave leave to bring a motion for spousal support on July 26, 2016, and made a productionorder.

[9]

On July 26, 2016 Mrs. Badrinarayan’s spousal support motion was not placed on a list

because it was not confirmed. It was rescheduled for October 27, 2000 2016 but adjourned onconsent to November 10, 2016. On November 9, 2016 the court was advised that on consent, themotion was adjourned to November 17, 2016.

[10]

Ultimately, the motion came on before LeMay, J. on November 25, 2016. He ordered that

this motion, insofar as it claimed support, would be the subject of a focused two day trial of anissue the week of April 3, 2017. He set a timetable for materials to be filed. He ordered that theaffidavits filed would be the examination in chief of the audience and that they be crossexamined, only, at the trial. Mrs. Badrinarayan asked LeMay, J. to make an order for interimsupport, without prejudice. He declined to do so.

During the marriage, both Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan worked, with short periods each of

unemployment, only when they were laid off or made redundant. Mrs. Badrinarayan appears tocouple bought from Mr. Badrinarayan’s sister the inventory of Mr. Badrinarayan’s sister’sconvenience store, and attempted to run the convenience store for themselves. They were notsuccessful and abandoned business.

[13]

While Mrs. Badrinarayan’s annual income fluctuated because of the periods of

unemployment, on an annualized basis her salary during the marriage was never less than

track to earn $47,000. In addition to her pay, and bonus, at Bentall she had a pension, medicaland extended health care benefits, and a stock purchase plan. Year to date, at the time she leftBentall in July, 2011, she earned as wages $24,633.48, but declared in her income tax returnincome for the year $27,464.

[19]

Mr. Badrinarayan also worked consistently throughout the marriage. After graduating

from high school in 1985, until August 1987, he worked and took computer and systems analystcourses. He obtained a computer programming diploma at DeVry Institute of Technology.
During this time, also, Mrs. Badrinarayan received her training at college as a medical secretary.

[21]

In November 1994, Mr. Badrinarayan began as a senior systems analyst with the KTS

Systems Group. This was a “9-to-5” job which paid approximately $45,000 a year. The familysupplemented their income by renting a basement apartment in their house at the time.

[22]

While Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan worked, Mrs. Badrinarayan’s mother and Mr.

Badrinarayan’s sisters watched the children. According to Mr. Badrinarayan, Mr. and Mrs.Badrinarayan shared household responsibilities equally, as between them, although her parentsalso did some tasks. The couple would come home in the evening and, together, cook theevening meal.

[23]

In July 1985 Mr. Badrinarayan left KTS for CanCom Business Network – Mobile as a

senior UNIX system specialist. In this job he traveled two or three times a year, two or three dayseach time, traveling around Canada to various locations providing software support. He receivedsome overtime when traveling.

[24]

From May, 1998 until February 2004, Mr. Badrinarayan was employed by Fujitsu

Technology Solutions as a senior systems engineer. He moved for slightly better pay.

[25]

From February 2004 until today Mr. Badrinarayan is employed as a senior systems

engineer with Oracle Canada. Originally the company was named Sun but was renamed duringthe time of his employment. Again this was a 9-to-5, Monday to Friday job. Travel was local, forthe most part.

During the marriage, the couple put all of their money in a joint bank account out of

which all family expenses were paid. They were completely integrated economically. They wereinterdependent. During their marriage, they own three houses, sequentially. They own themjointly. Neither one nor the other of Mr. or Mrs. Badrinarayan was responsible for specificexpenses.

-8-

Disputed factsMr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan disagree over certain issues. Mrs. Badrinarayan says that she

did most, if not all the cooking, cleaning, and child rearing responsibilities. Mr. Badrinarayandisagrees. He says that much of the housework was done by those people who were minding thechildren while Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan worked. To the extent that chores around the houseremained undone by those people, Mr. Badrinarayan says that he and his wife shared themrelatively equally. He says that they shared the cooking. They would come home from theirrespective jobs and prepare the evening meal, often starting at 6:30. He says that he was aninvolved father.

[29]

There is no doubt that Mrs. Badrinarayan sacrificed some time from work in having the

children, although no evidence was provided respect to how long, if at all, she was off work. It isreasonable that she would have taken some time, however short, to recover from giving birth toeach of her children.
Separation

[30]

Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan agree that they separated on August 4, 2011. The cause of

their separation, although unimportant to the issue of support, consumed a fair amount of paperin the written record and time at the hearing. Mr. Badrinarayan says that his wife “abandoned”
her marriage, her husband, and her children, to live with her new partner in Trinidad.

[31]

Mrs. Badrinarayan says the number of things which are not wholly consistent. First, she

claimed that there was mental abuse during the marriage which caused her to suffer frompsychiatric issues. She also said that the psychiatric issues led to a short period of disability fromwork immediately before she left Bentall in May, 2011. Her own evidence was vague in thisrespect. She produced no medical or psychiatric evidence to support it. I do not accept it.

[28]

-9-

[32]

She also said that Mr. Badrinarayan was having an affair before she began to see her later

partner, albeit during the marriage. Mr. Badrinarayan was not examined cross-examined on this

[33]

Mrs. Badrinarayan described her relationship with Mr. Devanand Indersingh (Davey) in

several different ways. I conclude, that she re-partnered with Mr. Davey. She says, however, thatas of the time she left the matrimonial home she had “developed a friendship with the individualwho later became my boyfriend.” In another affidavit she said that when she was staying inTrinidad (she admitted to spending the time 50-50 between Trinidad and Canada) she lived “atMr. Davey’s residence.” In her cross examination she referred to Mr. Davey as a “friend” and
“partner”. Ultimately, she said that when she was in Trinidad she stayed with Mr. Davey, andwhen in Canada, with her mother. The most telling of her evidence was that, when she wasquestioned why she boarded a plane to Trinidad on the same day that she left the marital home,she said that she wanted to go to Trinidad to start her new life with Mr. Davey.
August, 2011 to January 1, 2016

[34]

During this time, Mrs. Badrinarayan spent her time roughly equally between Trinidad and

Canada. She admitted in her cross examination that during this period she was unable to holddown a full-time job. No one would employ her given her commuter lifestyle. She conceded thatshe voluntarily left her employment at Bentall the end of May, 2011, to start her new life withMr. Davey. She said that, in order to live, she began to make withdrawals from the high interestsavings account containing her share of the proceeds from the sale of the family home and thatshe never earned more than $3000 in income after the date of separation. Her evidence in thisrespect is suspect. She never produced statements for her bank accounts. The only thing sheproduced was statements of account for the investment account into which she placed most ofher share, of the home equity. The only bank statement she produced begins in March 2016.

[35]

Records show that Mrs. Badrinarayan received almost $230,000 from the real estate

lawyer as her share of the house equity. She received perhaps another $5000 as her share of thehold back. The bank statements for her investment account show that by April 1, 2013, eight

Mr. Davey ended, her investment account contained approximately $160,000. Therefore,between July 1, 2012 and October 31, 2015, Mrs. Badrinarayan had depleted her fun by $80,000.

[36]

Mrs. Badrinarayan used her investment account statements as support for her position

that Mr. Davey did not support her. She says that she did not share in Mr. Davey’s income yet atthe same time says that he left money for household use when he was traveling. Even thoughMrs. Badrinarayan didn’t receive any money directly from Mr. Davey, it appears on all of theevidence that he was she lived at his expense.

[37]

Mrs. Badrinarayan’s investment account shows a change in her withdrawals beginning in

2016. In total, she redeemed $85,000 in 2016. Approximately $52,000 of this, however, was notused for personal expense. Rather, she bought two cars for, and loaned approximately $20,000 tovarious family members.

[38]

Mrs. Badrinarayan conceded that Mr. Davey was an engineer and owned his own house

in Trinidad and a house in Canada. He also owned to houses at two cars in Trinidad. While hisincome was never disclosed (because she didn’t ask for it), his income clearly allowed him tomaintain a very comfortable lifestyle. Mrs. Badrinarayan advised that since Mr. Davie worked inthe oil fields offshore, he paid no tax on the income that he earned.

[39]

Mrs. Badrinarayan confirmed that she did nothing with her share of the house equity

other than pay it into a high interest savings account. She did not invest in any negotiableinstruments or real estate.
Credibility

[40]

Law re-credibility

Mrs. Badrinarayan

Mrs. Badrinarayan’s evidence was imprecise and evasive. She was evasive with respect

to describing a relationship with Mr. Davey. She was imprecise and evasive with respect to heralleged disability shortly before she left Bentall. A finding of disability requires expert evidence,either from a doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist. No admissible evidence was produced fromany of these professionals. There was nothing produced support of Mrs. Badrinarayan’s claim to

[43]

There was no admissible evidence with respect to any physical disability. She produced a

letter dated July 12, 2006 from her general practitioner which says quote and has met mechanicallow back pain which has prevented her from working since 2011, and that she cannot sit forextended periods of time. This evidence is not admissible. Absent a notice under the EvidenceAct a medical report attached as an exhibit to an affidavit (other than by the physician signing theletter) is not admissible for the truth of its contents. Even if it were, I have doubts about itsaccuracy. The flight to Trinidad is between five and six hours. Mrs. Badrinarayan gave noevidence of having difficulty with those flights. Further, she has not applied for ODSP nor doesit appear from her income tax returns that she is receiving Canada Pension Plan or otherdisability payments. I reject claim of disability.

[44]

Mrs. Badrinarayan was also evasive when it came to her relationship with Mr. Davey.

[45]

Although Mrs. Badrinarayan abandoned any claim for support before August, 2016

attempted in her material to paint the picture that she was in need of support after the separationand that when she did the Canada she was forced to live with her mother and/or children. Shealso denied that Mr. Davey was supporting her.
c.

[46]

Mr. Badrinarayan

Mr. Badrinarayan’s evidence appears to be driven by money. He was cross-examined

extensively on his income tax returns and statements he made therein. What he says it at anygiven time appears to be designed to maximize his economic position with the person to whomhe makes statements.

[47]

Many inconsistencies were highlighted between his evidence in court and his statements

to the government. As a general rule, case law indicates the courts are not police for the taxauthorities. The court will not hold against a party the fact that he or she was aggressive in

any psychological disability was from the witness box.

- 13 maximizing his or her position with the tax authorities. However, Mr. Badrinarayan’s statementsgo beyond that. Mrs. Badrinarayan would have me conclude he was being fraudulent. I draw no

questions before this court. What are relevant, however, are the inconsistencies. Examples ofstatements that Mr. Badrinarayan made of that seriously and negatively affect his credibilityinclude:
a.

Suzanne, Mr. Badrinarayan’s former neighbour at the matrimonial home, isnow his common law partner. He says that each of them contributed
$100,000 to the down payment of their current home. Even though he is theonly one listed on title, Mr. Badrinarayan says that both he and Suzanne areequal owners of the home. They keep separate bank accounts. Suzanne pays
$1000 a month towards household expenses by paying the visa account. Hesays that her contribution is relatively low because she makes much less thanhe does.

Mr. Badrinarayan makes unequivocal statements to the contrary it comes toreporting

Badrinarayan says in his T1’s since 2012 that he is divorced. The portion ofpage one of his T1 where he would normally list details of his spouse’sincome is left blank. Suzanne says in her tax returns (which Mr.Badrinarayan prepares) that she is separated. That portion on page one of herT1 where she would normally list details of her spouse and spouse’s incomeis left blank. Mr. Badrinarayan explained this omission as arising from hiserroneous understanding that at law a cohabiting person did not become acommon-law spouse until after three years of cohabitation. I do not acceptthis. Based on Mr. Badrinarayan’s explanations of other problems with histax returns I find that this explanation is little more than a convenientrationalization.

- 14 -

b.

In Suzanne’s income tax forms (which he prepares) Mr. Badrinarayan saysthat he is a landlord and Suzanne is a tenant. He lists on her return a sum of

lease. There is no proof of any payments being transferred. Mr. Badrinarayandoes not declare as income the rent Suzanne declares she’s paying him.
Mr. Badrinarayan’s explanation for this is that Suzanne was paying property taxesand the amount of money that he stated in her return that was paid his rentwas in fact the property tax. I do not accept this. Mr. Badrinarayan’srepresentations in Suzanne’s tax return that she is paying rent are made inthat section in which Suzanne is claiming the Trillium benefit. The Trilliumis designed to reimburse tenants, partially, for property taxes included in theirrent. Mr. Badrinarayan confirms Suzanne is claiming the Trillium benefit.
c.

Mr. Badrinarayan knows that the representations he makes about his incomeare not correct. He knows that when he signs his income tax returns withthese intentionally false statements, “it is a serious offense to make a falsereturn” to use the language of the signing portion of the T1. He knows thatwhen he says “I certify that the information given us return and in anydocuments attached is correct complete and fully discloses all of my income”
that he is making a false statement. Further, he knows that when he hasSuzanne signed the tax return he has prepared containing what he knows tobe false statements, he is exposing her to penalties ranging from interest tofines, to jail.

Badrinarayan is the only owner as the sole proprietor of the couple’s printingbusiness which they operate out of the house. He says that this business istheirs, jointly. However, he reports the business as his. In order to minimize
(in this case is eliminate) taxable income from the business, he mustmaximize his deductions. Were he to register the house in both their names,he would only be able to take advantage of half of the deductions. Mr.Badrinarayan also receives dividend, capital gains income and other businessincome. He needs to maximize his deductions in order to offset other taxablebusiness, dividend and capital gains income.
e.

Mr. Badrinarayan claims that he owes to his brother the sum of $57,600. Hesaid that beginning in January 1989, his brother, Frank Badrinarayan, agreedto lend him $300 each month, which he transferred in cash. That loan endedin December 2004, totalled $57,600, and was to be repaid of yet at the end of2005. Mr. Badrinarayan produced a demand notice dated 8 August 2016.
While this document is relevant to property (an issue not before me), it doesgo to Mr. Badrinarayan’s credibility. The “payment on demand notice” thebrother sent on August 8, 2016 is highly suspect. It is dated in 2016 althoughthe debt was payable on January 1, 2005. No demand appears to have beenmade. No written demand was made in 2005, when the loan was not paid. Nodemand was made in 2011 following the date of the separation. No demandwas made in December 2011 when Mr. Badrinarayan applied for the divorceor following the granting of the divorce in August 2012. No demand wasmade following June 22, 2012 in the house was sold. Mr. Badrinarayan didnot pay it back out of the 230,000 he received from the sale of the house.

Finally, Mr.Badrinarayan’s brother was not called to explain why demands were made atsignificant steps in this action, and waited until after Donohue, J. set the datefor the support motion.
In any event, Mr. Badrinarayan had no need for the loan from his brother. Exceptin those years where Mr. Badrinarayan suffered losses in his selfemployment he continued to make deposits into his RRSP which exceededthe amount he borrowed in that year. All circumstances considered, I do notaccept that there was a loan, from the brother to Mr. and Mrs. Badrinarayan.
Entitlement to spousal support

[48]

Section 15.2 (6) provides that orders for spousal support can be awarded on a (a)

compensatory, (b) contractual, and (c) non-compensatory basis.
Objectives of spousal support

[49]

Section15 (6) of the Divorce Act, provides that spousal support should:
1.
2.

3.
4.

Recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spousesarising from the marriage or its breakdown;Apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising fromthe care of any child of the marriage over and above any obligation for thespouse of any child of the marriage;Relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising the breakdown ofthe marriage; andInsofar far as is practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of thespouse within a reasonable period of time.

application in September, 2014 or following respondent’s filing his answer.

- 17 -

[50]

I will address each of the three kinds of support in light of these objectives, recognizing

that no one objective predominates. All four objectives must be balanced in the confines of this

Contractual support

[51]

Mr. Badrinarayan says that by contract, Mrs. Badrinarayan waived entitlement to support.

He says that when they separated, Mrs. Badrinarayan agreed that in exchange for her half of theequity in the house, she would forgo all claims for equalization and support. Mrs. Badrinarayandenies this. Mr. Badrinarayan has the onus of establishing that by contract Mrs. Badrinarayansurrendered the right to claim equalization and support. He has not done so. I find no compellingevidence that a contract of the nature he alleges, existed. There is no document at the time of theagreement, or at the time of the sale and payment of the proceeds that supports the inference ofan agreement. I am faced with his statement that the agreement was reached, and hers that it wasnot. This is one of those instances where I accept her evidence over his.

Compensatory support

[52]

Section 15.2 of the Divorce Act looks at marriage as a joint endeavor. Therefore, where

required, orders for spousal support are designed to be compensatory, to bring about the sharingof the property in the relationship and address the advantages or disadvantages that arise to theparties flowing from the relationship.

[53]

In Moge v. Moge, L’ Heureux-Dube, J. said:
“In short, compensatory spousal support is premised on a marriage being a joint endeavorbetween spouses. By recognizing the value of non-monetary contributions to the maritalunion, compensatory support seeks to alleviate the economic loss of the disadvantagedspouse through an equitable distribution the benefit of the marriage.”

[54]

She later commented:
“Essentially, compensatory support intends both spouses profit from the joint ventureaffairs. The question is not what the disadvantage spouse would have achieved had he orshe not entered into the marriage rather, the question is what is that spouses contribution

case.

to the marriage and was the other spouse this advantage by that contribution if so, doesequity demand the sharing of any advantage gained should be the benefit of an eventspouse be apportioned. In practical terms, the issue will generally revolve around whetherone spouse has gained an advantage in his or her ability to earn income or acquire assetsthat should be shared for at least some period of time. (At para. 45).”

[55]

In this case, the parties’ relationship was one of financial interdependence. However,

Mrs. Badrinarayan did not give up any pay, advancement, raises, or employment opportunities.
She confirmed that when she was unemployed it was because of layoff or restructuring. I notethat she did give birth to four children. I accept the burdens that women face in caring forchildren and that this fact would usually require some compensatory support. I have no evidencein terms of the time that Mrs. Badrinarayan took off work, for example, for maternity leave, andwhat affect that absence from work had on her earning capacity or ability.

[56]

With respect to work around the house and child raising obligations, I have contradictory

evidence. Mrs. Badrinarayan said that she was the main caregiver and did most of the caregivingand housekeeping in the family. Mr. Badrinarayan says that they split these tasks evenly. In lightof the contradictory evidence in the parties, I cannot accept one or the other’s version of events.
Therefore, I cannot conclude on the evidence before me that Mrs. Badrinarayan suffered anyeconomic and that disadvantages from the marriage for its breakdown, or any economichardship. Conversely I cannot conclude that Mr. Badrinarayan sustain any economic advantageson the marriage or its breakdown.
Non-compensatory support

[57]

Non-compensatory support is a residual basis for ordering support quote where it is fit

and just to do so.

[58]

O.R. (3d) 789, discussed the various bases of spousal support.

Weiler J.A. described non-

compensatory support as follows, at para. 65:
Non-compensatory support focuses on the mutual obligation that arises from the marriageitself, the expectations of the parties when they married, and the need to grant relief fromhardship flowing from the break-up of the marriage: Bracklow, supra, at paras. 48-49.

- 18 -

Thus, non-compensatory support arises where there is an economic dependency that maybe due to a variety of factors such as age, illness or disability. It is apparent that thesefactors need not necessarily be connected to the marriage. Where the marriage is ofrelatively short duration and there are no children of the relationship, however, economicself-sufficiency carries greater weight when considering the expectations of the parties:
Rogerson, supra at 281…

[59]

In this case, I am mindful of the Court of Appeal’s instruction in Fisher v. Fisher that

economic self-sufficiency with this connotation of economic independence is a relative concept.
It should be interpreted not has the ability to meet basic expenses but as the ability support astandard of living that is reasonable having regard to the economic hardships of the parties andthe economic partnership the parties enjoyed and sustained during cohabitation and which theclaimant could reasonably anticipate afterwards. This requires a look into the parties’ incomes,the standard of living during cohabitation, the parties post separation circumstances the length oftheir cohabitation and other relevant factors.

[60]

As the Court of Appeal stated in Linton (1990) 1 O.R. (3d) 1 (C. A.) at para. 27 – 28;
“Self-sufficiency is often more attainable in short term marriages, particularly oneswithout children, where the lower income spouse has not become entrenched in aparticular lifestyle or compromised career aspirations. In such circumstances lowerincome spouse is expected either to have the tools to become financially independent orto adjust his or her standard of living. New para in contrast, in most long term marriages,particularly in the traditional long-term ones, the parties merger of economic lifestylescreates a joint standard of living at the lower income spouse cannot hope to replicate, butupon which he or she has become dependent. Any in such circumstances, the spousalsupport analysis typically will not give priority to self-sufficiency because it is anobjective that simply cannot be attained.”

[61]

This is a case of a long term marriage. The parties were married for 26 years and had four

children. There was complete economic integration between the parties during the marriage.
While both worked during the marriage, Mr. Badrinarayan earned over double Mrs.Badrinarayan’s income.

[62]

Therefore, on a non-compensatory basis, I find that Mrs. Badrinarayan is entitled support.

She, over 26 years, became used to standard of living based on their combined income ofsomewhere between 125,000 and $175,000.

- 19 -

- 20 -

[63]

In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful that both of the lawyers agreed in argument

that had Mrs. Badrinarayan claimed support spousal support at the time that she left the marital

The Effect of Delay

[64]

Mr. Badrinarayan argues that in delaying claiming support for the time she lived with Mr.

Davey, Mrs. Badrinarayan disentitled herself to support on the facts of this case since the delaywas long, and not adequately explained. Further, the delay is evidence of the contract that Mr.Badrinarayan says existed. If support is awarded it should be at half the low end of the range. Hecites as support for his propositions HJK v. JEB [1997] B.C. J. No. 2705 (B,C.C.A.), Broumas v.
Broumas, 1998 ABQB 598, Greaves v. Greaves, [2004] O.J. No. 2522 (S.C.J.) , Howe v. Howe,2012 ONSC 2736, Walker v. Greer, [2003] O.J. No. 3396 (S.C.J.), Archibald v. Archibald 2000
BVSC 1219, Rezel v. Rezel, [2007] O.J. No. 1460 (S.C.J. ), Morgan v. Morgan, 2006 NLTD 6,Quackenbush v. Quackenbush, 22013 ONSC 7547 (S.C.J.)..

[65]

Delay, as a general rule, does not affect entitlement unless the delay is unreasonable. As

[2000] B.C.J. No. 1660 (S.C.); and Olsson v. Olsson, [1992] B.C.J. No. 2516 (S.C.).

[66]

In Kripotos, the parties were separated for 5 years by the time of trial, and the application

was commenced two years before trial.

The wife’s explanation for delay was found to be

reasonable in that the husband paid support for a period, failed to make disclosure for a time, shedepleted her capital.

She started to take a course in accounting to improve her skills but could

not complete it due to financial circumstances.

[67]

In this case, I accept Mrs. Badrinarayan’s explanation for the delay. On the one hand, she

lived with another man. She lived off her capital to an extent. When her new relationship failed,

home, she probably would have been entitled to it.

- 21 -

she obtained at least one contract position.

Further, in not claiming support (to which Mr.

Badrinarayan agrees she would have been entitled had she claimed it immediately after the

[68]

I reject Mr. Badrinarayan’s claim that Mrs. Badrinarayan is disentitled to spousal support

because of delay. Delay still is relevant to quantum and may reduce it (see Dingle v. Dingle,2010 ONCJ 731, add’l reasons at 2010 ONCJ 734), which I address below.

[69]

Further, Mr. Badrinarayan argues that entitlement to spousal support cannot be founded

on need arising from intentional unemployment or underemployment.

Mrs. Badrinarayan

cannot hold Mr. Badrinarayan responsible for the economic consequences of a decision that wasunreasonable in the circumstances, citing see Hodgkinson v. Hodgkinson, 2003 BCSC 1538 andUzelac v. Uzelac, 2003 BCSC 665.

[70]
R.F.L. (4th) 314 (B.C.C.A.). So does Mrs. Badrinarayan. She makes no claim for support forthe period during which she cohabited with Mr. Davey.

Quantum and duration of spousal supportMr. Badrinarayan’s Income for Support

[71]

Mrs. Badrinarayan takes the position that support should be calculated on Mr.

Badrinarayan’s whole income. This includes his T4, dividend, rental, and capital gains income.
She says that she supported him during the marriage while he developed his skills as a day-traderand his skills in business, many of which he learned from their failed attempt to run theconvenience store. Mr. Badrinarayan takes the position that if support is to be a given, it shouldbe on his income from his T4 sources and renting the apartment in the home. It should notinclude his income from day-trading, or the rental property he purchased with his share of theequity in the marital residence. That property was acquired after the separation.
business skills he developed after the marriage ended.

Further, his

separation), she has saved Mr. Badrinarayan a great deal in spousal support.

- 22 -

[72]

Mrs. Badrinarayan also says that most of the deductions that Mr. Badrinarayan has taken

against his business income should be attributed back to him. He has been overly aggressive and,

house for the business he runs in the house without adequately justifying that percentage. Hesays, repeatedly, and that is what he does in terms of deductions against income, is what he’sbeen told is reasonable. There is no evidence in this regard.

[73]

For calculation of future support, the husband’s income comprises his T4 line 150

income. I find that his day trading business and his rental business of the separate rental propertydo not form part of his income for support calculation purposes. That portion of his incomearises from investments he made after the marriage ended. It cannot be said that these sources ofincome arise from the marriage. Therefore, Mr. Badrinarayan’s income for support purposes is:
2014

$110,855

2015

$108,593

2016

$110,915

Mrs. Badrinarayan’s Income for Support

[74]

Mrs. Badrinarayan conceded that in 2011 she walked away from a job that would have

paid $47,000 per year and that her jobs generally paid in the range of $45,000.

[75]

Mr. Badrinarayan says that I should attribute to her an increase of at least 1% per year,

and impute income to her reflecting the fact that her capital sum of $350,000 could have earnedincome, had it been invested.

[76]

I do not accept his position for several reasons.

at times, on the wrong side of income tax law. For example, he writes off 65% of his current

- 23 -

a. First, with respect to her income from employment, his position requiresevidence that Mrs. Badrinarayan would have received increases in her

notice of wage inflation in her line of work.
b. Even if I could impute an increase in her wages, I would also have toreduce them for negative contingencies such as the possibility that shewould have lost her job in the intervening years. There was no evidenceof this.
c. Mr. Badrinarayan ’s position requires evidence with respect to whatinvestments would have been reasonable, and what those investmentswould have returned. He led no such evidence.

[77]

Accordingly, I impute to Mrs. Badrinarayan today and in the future $47.000.

What is the Quantum of Spousal Support?

[78]

Mr. Badrinarayan says the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines (SSAGs) are purely

guidelines; they are not determinative. He says support should be at the low end or below the lowend of the ranges set by the SSAGs.

[79]

The Court of Appeal, in Slongo v. Slongo 2017 ONCA 272 held that while the SSAGs are

guidelines, they should not be departed from except in unusual circumstances (see paragraph 81
– 10). In that case, given the length of the marriage (23 years) and given the age of the wife, theCourt held that the Wife was entitled to spousal support on a level commensurate with thestandard of living the parties enjoyed during the marriage.

[80]

In this case, the SSAG ranges on the incomes above are as follows:
Year

HisIncome2014 $110,855

wages. No such evidence was presented, and I am not able to take judicial

- 24 -

2016 $110,915

$1,997

$2,330

$2,641

The SSAGs set out a number of factors to consider when determining where, within the

range, spousal support should fall. In this case, the following factors are relevant:
a.

Mrs. Badrinarayan has no compensatory support claim.

b.

Mr. Badrinarayan has healthy income from employment, absent anybusiness income or losses.

c.

Mrs. Badrinarayan has the capacity to earn $47,000 per year.

d.

Mrs. Badrinarayan has relatively standard needs.

e.

Mrs. Badrinarayan re-partnered at the time of separation, but that endedthat relationship.

f.

The marriage was long term.

g.

Both parties worked throughout the marriage, except for periods ofunemployment caused by external forces. Such periods were brief.

h.

Both parties, early in the marriage, earned technical qualifications toimprove income prospects.

i.

Mrs. Badrinarayan, at the time of separation, gave up a job that paid
$47,000 that year. At the time of separation, she was approximately 42
years of age. Today, she is approximately 48, and is likely much lesslikely to be fully employed for the remainder of her working life. Thisfact, however, is a result of her removing herself from the workforce, andnot an effect of the marriage or its end.

j.

Mrs. Badrinarayan requires an incentive to attain self-sufficiency. Sincethe beginning of 2015, she says that he has looked for work throughagencies, on line sources, and newspapers, and has sent in a large numberof resumes and applications. She has only obtained one period of contractemployment. Because of my credibility assessment, however, I do notaccept that she sent in the resumes and looked as hard for work as sheclaims.

[81]

$47,000

[82]

m.

Equalization has not been decided, although the net proceeds of the homewere divided equally, in July, 2012.

n.

Mrs. Badrinarayan has not addressed the issue of what support, if any, shemight be able to expect from Mr. Davey. This factor has played little rolein my decision. Given that the relationship with Mr. Davey was between 4
and 6 years, support from him would have been minimal. Further, I do notknow whether he was or is a Canadian resident over whom the Court hasjurisdiction.

In my view, based on all the factors prevalent in this case, the range of support should be

at or near the lowest end of the SSAG range (see Heimsoth v., Heimsoth, 2009 ABCA 129).
Past Support

[83]

For purposes of past support, I fix the support owing at $1,900 per month.

[84]

Mrs. Badrinarayan claims support from August 1, 2016, onward. I infer that she concedes

that her need began only then because her relationship with Mr. Davey had ended and her capitalwas largely eroded. I accept this. Therefore, past spousal support from August 1, 2016 to May1, 2017 is $19,000.00
Future Support – Amount

[85]

For May 1 and June 1, 2017, Mr. Badrinarayan shall pay spousal support of $1,900,

directly to Ms. Badrinarayan.

[86]

For spousal support from July 1, 2017 and every year thereafter beginning on July 1, Mr.

Badrinarayan shall pay support on the following rules:
1.
2.
3.

Spousal Support shall be at the low level determined by the SSAGs.
Mr. Badrinarayan’s income for spousal support purposes shall be his line150 assessed income.
Mrs. Badrinarayan’s income for spousal support purposes shall be thegreater of $47,000 and her actual income.

- 25 -

- 26 -

[87]

The parties will exchange T1 and CRA assessments by June 1 of each year commencing

June 1, 2017. Spousal support payable for the 12 months beginning July 1, 2017 and on July 1

statements provided in the previous June.
Future Spousal Support - Duration

[88]

The SSAGs suggest that the duration of support is indefinite.

[89]

In Heimsoth, supra, the Court held that delay was addressed by reducing the amount of

spousal support.

It held that the duration should continue to be indefinite.

In similar

circumstances, the support may also be time limited (see Walker Bodnarek v. Bodnarek, 2005
SKQB 462). In a long term marriage, where the dependent spouse is unlikely to achieve selfsufficiency in the foreseeable future, support was indefinite (see Martin v. Martin (2011) 81 O.R.
(3d) 503 (C.A.).

[90]

In this case, I have no doubt that but for her removal from the work force for a number of

years, Mrs. Badrinarayan would have been self-sufficient by now.

Her voluntary self-removal

from the work force, and the effect of that withdrawal on her self-sufficiency, is not somethingthat Mr. Badrinarayan should be responsible for.

On the other hand, self-sufficiency is not a

self-standing goal. It should been seen in the context of the relationship and other goals ofsupport.

[91]

In this case, I must consider not only the need to promote Mrs. Badrinarayan’s self-

sufficiency, I must also address the hardships arising from the breakdown of the marriage, whichhave been deferred because Mrs. Badrinarayan re-partnered for a while.

[92]

Mrs. Badrinarayan needs time to adjust to self-sufficiency to adjust to her income earning

capacity, and to adjust to a new standard of living having enjoyed a much greater standard ofliving during the marriage. Both parties, in argument, agreed that had she sought support at thetime of separation, she likely would have been entitled to it.

Mr. Badrinarayan has had the

benefit of not paying spousal support since the breakdown of the marriage, which he admits he

of every year after shall be determined based on the Rules as above, and the T1 and CRA

- 27 -

would have been required to pay.

On the facts of the case, Mrs. Badrinarayan’s entitlement to

support at the date of separation, had she sought it, would have been on a needs basis, and

[93]

Where spousal support entitlement is non-compensatory and therefore ordered to relieve

against the economic consequences of the end of the marriage and to allow the recipient to adjustto economic independence and self-sufficiency, time limited support may be reasonable (seeBracklow v. Bracklow, (1999) 1 S.C.R. 420). The husband asks that I make a sort, time limitedsupport order.

[94]

I must also consider that Mrs. Badrinarayan withdrew from the work force voluntarily

thereby impairing her ability to achieve self-sufficiency.

The consequences of her withdrawal

from the work force for 4 to 5 years are Mrs. Badrinarayan’s to shoulder, not Mr.Badrinarayan’s.

[95]

I have every confidence that Mrs. Badrinarayan will be able to return to the work force

and earn $47,000 p.a. I have every confidence that she will achieve self-sufficiency. To give herincentive to do so, I order that Mrs. Badrinarayan’s entitlement to spousal support is to bereviewed, at the instance of either party, not earlier than 3 years from the date of these reasons.
Costs

[96]

Unless the parties can agree on costs, I will decide the issue of who should pay whom

costs, in writing.

Submissions are limited to 10 pages, double spaced, excluding bills of costs

and cases. Mr. Badniarayan’s submissions are to be served and filed by 4 p.m., 9 June, 2017 andMrs. Badnararayan’s by 2 p.m., 13 June, 2017.
