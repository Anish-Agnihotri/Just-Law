ENDORSEMENT

INTRODUCTION

[1]

There are two motions before the court.

[2]
The respondent mother brings a motion for an order striking the applicant father’spleading for failure to comply with the following court orders:

[3]

(1)

The August 5, 2015 consent order of Thorburn J.

(2)

The July 20, 2016 consent order of Hood J.

(3)

The January 4, 2017 order of Mesbur J.

(4)

The February 7, 2017 cost order of Harvison-Young J.

In response, the applicant father brings a motion for the following orders:
(1)

Setting aside the court order of Thorburn J. and paras. 4 and 5 of theorder of Hood J. directing the father to make full disclosure and paysupport;

COURT FILE NO.: FS-14-396637
DATE: 20170519

(2)

Setting aside the arrears of child support and spousal support. The arrearsas of May 1, 2017 total $22,361;

(3)

Directing that the mother comply with the order of Thorburn J.;

(4)

Removing the Office of the Children's Lawyer from this application;

(5)

Directing that the children undergo a pyscho-educational assessment anddirecting that the father have “reintegration therapy” with the children.

[4]
While the father’s motion seeks to “set aside” orders, this is in fact a motion tovary interim orders that were made on consent.
THE BACKGROUND

[5]
The father and mother were married on March 14, 2000 and separated in June2013. They have two children ages 16 and 13.

[6]
The father issued his application for a simple divorce on August 6, 2014. Themother filed an answer on July 5, 2015. In the answer, the mother advanced her ownclaims for a divorce, custody of the children, child and spousal support and equalization.
The father never filed a reply to the mother’s answer.

[7]
On August 5, 2015, the parties attended a case conference before Thorburn J.
and she issued a consent order. The parties were represented by counsel. This orderdirected the father to disclose his complete corporate tax returns and bank statements.
He was also ordered to pay $892 a month for child support and $714 a month forspousal support. The order states that the support is based on an imputed income of
$60,000.

[8]
The order of Thorburn J. also directed the mother to disclose what happened to
$28,000 that she removed from a bank account. Finally, the order requested that thematter be referred to the Children's Lawyer for their assistance with the children and theissue of access. The Children's Lawyer accepted the request and appointed counsel forthe children.

[9]
A further case conference was held on July 20, 2016 before Hood J. The partieswere represented by counsel. A consent order was issued dealing with the father’saccess to the children, the father’s disclosure and his obligation to continue makingsupport payments. The parties signed a consent that was witnessed by counsel. Theorder gives the father access to the children as arranged by the Children's Lawyer andrequired mother to make best efforts to encourage the children to see the father.
Further, the father was ordered to make “full disclosure” including the followingdocuments:
(a)

personal and business tax returns;

(b)

business evaluation;

(c)

bank statements;

(d)

credit card statements;

(e)

RESP statements;

(f)

income analysis

[10] On November 24, 2016, the mother brought a motion for custody of the children.
Kiteley J. granted the mother temporary custody of the children. In her endorsement,Kiteley J. states that the father is in breach of the support orders and had accumulatedsupport arrears of $15,937. Further, Kiteley J. states that the children do not wish to seetheir father and there was no evidence that the mother was causing the children to bealienated from the father.

[11] On January 4, 2107, a settlement conference was held. Mesbur J. issued aconsent order granting the mother sole custody of the children. In her endorsement,Mesbur J. states that the father’s disclosure “remains outstanding and has since 2015”.
Mesbur J. ordered that the father “shall fully comply with Hood J’s order by March 1,2017 failing which the respondent is free to move to strike his pleadings on the basis ofhis continued failure to comply with court-ordered disclosure”.

[12] In addition to the disclosure already ordered, Mesbur J. ordered that the fatherproduce the Minute Book and Share Registry for Dunleavy Cordun Inc. and DunleavyCordun Associates Inc. Finally, Mesbur J. ordered that questioning was permitted, buthad to be completed by April 18, 2017. A trial management conference was set forJune 5, 2017.

[13] The father was represented by counsel when all of the above orders were made.
After Mesbur J’s order the father became self-represented.

[14] On February 7, 2017, the father brought a motion before Harvison-Young J.
seeking an order that funds the mother withdrew from the Dunleavy Cordun Inc.
corporate bank account be applied to the support arrears that he owes. Harvison-YoungJ. dismissed the motion. She stated that the evidence about the withdrawal of themonies was in dispute. The father said that the withdrawal of the money had ruined hisbusiness and prospects. The mother said that the father’s conduct was the cause of hisproblems and she had to withdraw the money because she was in dire need of funds forherself and the children. The motion judge directed that the issue of the mother’swithdrawal of $28,000 from the account be considered within the context ofequalization. Lastly, the motion judge noted that the father had not met his disclosureobligations and the deadline of March 1, 2017 set by Mesbur J.

[15] The mother brought a motion to strike the father’s pleading. This motion camebefore me on April 25, 2017. The father had filed an affidavit sworn April 19, 2017
stating that he had complied with the documentary disclosure orders, but he offered noproof. As well, the father had served the mother with his own motion dated April 30,2017, but it was not properly served. The motions were adjourned to allow for properservice and to give the father an opportunity to file a further affidavit.

[16]
The father then filed an affidavit sworn on May 1 2017 and a form 14B motiondated April 30, 2017 that incorrectly states that his motion is on consent.

[17] While the father has filed two notices of motion, both dated April 30, 2017, I willdeal with them as one because they seek the same relief.

[18]

The mother filed a responding affidavit sworn May 3, 2017.

[19] At the start of the hearing of the motions, the father served the mother with anaffidavit sworn on May 11, 2017. With the consent of the mother, I allowed the father tofile this last affidavit.

[20]

Lastly, a trial management conference is set for June 5, 2017.

ANALYSIS
Status of Father’s Disclosure

[21] The father has not complied with the disclosure orders. The limited disclosurethat has been provided is reviewed below. Much of the disclosure is unclear,contradictory and fails to support the father’s affidavit evidence.

[22] When the father filed his first financial statement, sworn July 31, 2015, heattached his personal income tax returns for 2012, 2013 2014. He later producedNotices of Reassessment that reveal the following information.

[23]
In the 2012 income tax return, the father’s line 150 income was $60,000. A
Notice of Reassessment for 2012 confirms the $60,000 income and a balance owing of
$55,228.42. There is no evidence to explain the balance owed.

[24] In 2013, the father reported “NIL” income on his income tax return. However inthe Notice of Reassessment the line 150 income is $85,366. The Notice ofReassessment states that the father owes $55,407.33. There is no evidence to explainthis difference in income or the balance owed.

[25] In the 2014 income tax return, the father reported “0” income. In the Notice ofReassessment for 2014, the line 150 income is $74,366 with $14,366.09 owed. There isno evidence to explain this difference in income or the balance owed.

[26] The father has not produced his income tax returns for 2015 or 2016. Heobviously filed a 2015 income tax return because a Notice of Reassessment wasissued. This Notice shows “0” income and a balance owed of $57,402.98.
The father has not produced any personal bank statements.

[28] The father has not complied with the order to produce credit card statements. Heproduced one credit card statement from Hudson’s Bay for the period October 17, 2016
to November 16, 2016. It shows a previous total balance owing of $7,340.57. No otherstatements are provided for this credit card. The father’s affidavit reveals that he had aCIBC Visa card as of June 2013, because a balance owing on the card was paid usingsale proceeds of the matrimonial home. Credit card statements for the Visa card are notproduced. It is not known if the father has or had any other credit cards for whichstatements must be provided. He has provided no evidence.

[29] The orders directing production of corporate tax returns and bank statementsrefer to Dunleavy Cordun Inc. This company was incorporated on June 7, 2012. TheArticles of Incorporation list the mother as the sole director. Other documents describethe father as the president of the company. Both parties had signing privileges at thebank. On August 1, 2014, the mother resigned as a director of the company andtendered her shares to the father.

[30] The father has not produced the corporate tax returns for Dunleavy Cordun Inc. Itis unclear if any corporate income tax returns have ever been filed with RevenueCanada.

[31] The father attached to his affidavit a typed undated and unsigned letter from
“Steve Walsh”. This is part of a group of documents marked as exhibit 30 to the father’saffidavit sworn on May 1, 2017. The father says that Mr. Walsh is his former accountant.
This letter is not on the letterhead of Mr. Walsh. There is no address or any contactinformation on this letter for Mr. Walsh, who apparently prepared this letter andaddressed it to “Bill”.

[32] The Walsh letter purports to give an estimate for the preparation of financialstatements. The letter does not reveal the name of any company that is the subject ofthe estimate. The letter refers to the “experience putting together the 2013 results”. IfDunleavy is the company that is the subject of this letter, the 2013 results for thecompany have not been produced. An estimate of $5,000 is given for bookkeeping fees,financial statements and corporate tax returns for a company that is not identified in theletter.

[33] The father has produced 4 statements from Dunleavy’s Scotiabank accountcovering the period of September 2014 to April 2015. This shows that he has access tothe corporate bank statements. Four monthly statements is not full disclosure.

[27]

[35] Dunleavy Cordun Associates Inc. is a company that the father used to own. Hestates that it ceased to operate in 2012 and he does not know where the Minute Bookand Share Register are for this company. As a result, he says that he cannot complywith Mesbur J.’s order. He does not describe any efforts to locate these documents.
Articles of Incorporation for this company are not attached to his affidavit.

[36] The father now states that he cannot afford to pay for the business valuation andincome analysis that he agreed to in the consent order of Hood J. He has provided aletter from AP Valuations showing that an income valuation for 2012-2015 will cost
$7,500 -$10,000 and a business valuation will cost $5000 - $10,000. However, whenthe father agreed to the consent order in July 2016, he was unemployed as of June2016 (according to his sworn financial statement dated March 7, 2016).

[37]
The father has not complied with the order of Hood J. to produce the RESP
statements. He produced a single page which appears to be generated from a RESP
account with CST. It is not dated and is incomplete.
Father’s Financial Statements

[38] In the father’s July 31, 2015 financial statement, he states that he is employed byDunleavy Cordun Inc., that he earned no income in the previous year and that his selfemployment income before expenses is $6,736/month ($80,832/year). The source ofthe self-employment income is not revealed.

[39] In his July 12, 2016 financial statement, the father states that he is selfemployed. The name and address of the business is not revealed. The gross incomefrom all sources in the previous year is $60,000. Self-employment income beforeexpenses is $5,000.

[40] In his March 7, 2017 financial statement, the father states that he has beenunemployed since June 2016 and receives $706/month from social assistance. Hisgross income from all source for the previous year is $1,600. This financial statementconflicts with the July 12, 2016 financial statement in which he states he is selfemployed with gross monthly earnings of $5,000.
Father’s Evidence about Financial Problems

[41] The father states that he cannot afford to pay support, obtain a businessvaluation or income analysis or pay the costs order. He was approved for Ontario Worksas of October 13, 2016 and receives $1,138.71 a month. He also has a drug benefiteligibility card.

[34] The father states that he does not know where the Minute Book and ShareRegister for Dunleavy Cordun Incorporated are located. He does not describe anyefforts to locate these documents.

[43] The father states that he is not working and cannot find a job. This is contrary toevidence from the mother. She provided an announcement from Glass Magazine datedJanuary 7, 2017. This announcement states that “Nathan Allan Glass Studios welcomedtwo new sales representatives to its network. Bill Kahansky of Dunleavy Cordun Inc willcover the Ontario and Quebec territory”.

[44] The father’s most recent affidavit responded to this information. He states that heis trying to sell products with Nathan Allan and Lamboo. He provided a letter from eachcompany. The undated letters state that the father has not been paid any commissionsto date.

[45] The father is the president of Dunleavy Cordun and continues to identify himselfwith the company in various emails that he has sent.

[46] The father states that his financial problems were caused by the mother’swithdrawal of $28,000 from Dunleavy Cordun’s corporate bank account. He states themother withdrew “all of the corporate bank account funds”. There are no bankingrecords to support this allegation. Because the mother withdrew all of the money, fatherstates that he has no money to obtain the documents that the court ordered and cannotpay support.

[47] The mother withdrew the $28,000 from the Cordun bank account in July 2015. Itis her evidence that she did so because the father was not paying support. Themother’s only source of income is welfare.

[48] In his affidavit, the father states that the withdrawal of the $28,000 “triggeredseveral other issues” that he describes as follows:

The money withdrawn belonged to customers.

After the money was withdrawn, the company had no money to paysuppliers for materials and orders could not be fulfilled. As a result thecompany received no further orders.

Because no orders came in, the father could not expect to earn anyincome from the company and could not pay support.

The mother removed “all of the corporate funds”.

[49] There is no evidence to support the father’s assertion that the withdrawal of the
$28,000 “triggered several other issues”. What is attached to his affidavit does notsupport this evidence.

[42] A statement from FRO dated May 1 2017 shows that the father paid support of
$1900 on 6 occasions (May – September 2016) for a total of $11,400. The statementconfirms that the arrears of support total $22,326 as of May 1, 2017.

[50] To support his statement that the $28,000 belonged to customers, the fatherproduced seven purchase orders from customers during the first half of 2015. The priceon one purchase order was $108,848.09 and a second purchase order was for $86,500.
No amounts are revealed on other purchase orders. There is no evidence of paymentsreceived from customers that were deposited into the Dunleavy Cordun bank account.
There is also no evidence that the mother removed “all of the corporate funds”.

[51] The father also blames the lawyer who represented him when the order ofThorburn J. was issued on August 5, 2015. He now states that he gave his lawyerexplicit instructions not to agree to any support because he had no money to paysupport. The fact that he is blaming the lawyer almost two years after the order wassigned is a convenient excuse that lacks credibility. If true, I would expect this to havebeen raised by the next lawyer who represented the father. It was never raised as anexcuse for non-payment until this motion.

[52] On April 20, 2017, the father issued a statement of claim in the Superior Courtagainst his former lawyer, the mother and mother’s counsel. In essence, he blames allof them for mother’s withdrawal of the $28,000. Of note, the father does not allege inthis statement of claim that his former counsel acted contrary to his instructions, as henow claims.
FATHER’S MOTION TO VARY THE INTERIM ORDERS

[53] I will deal with the father’s motion first and explain why the relief he seeks isdenied.

[54] The father’s motion to set aside the various orders is in fact a motion to varyinterim orders that directed him to make disclosure and pay support.

[55]

The father also seeks relief concerning the children.

The Children

[56] The Children's Lawyer appointed counsel for the children because it was in thebest interests of the children to do so. The father did not serve counsel for the childrenwith his motion. There is absolutely no evidence to support the father’s request thatcounsel be removed and it is denied.

[57] The father’s request that the children undergo a psycho-educational assessmentand have reintegration therapy with the father is also denied. As noted, he should haveserved counsel for the children with his motion. The mother has a final order for solecustody of the children and it is her responsibility to make health and educationdecisions for the children. Kiteley J previously rejected the father’s assertion that themother was alienating the children against the father. This relief is denied.

Mother’s Compliance with Order of Thorburn J.

[59] The mother has explained that she and the children do not have enough moneyto live. The mother learned that the father had withdrawn $30,000 from DunleavyCordun’s bank account. She withdrew half of the remaining balance. The mother hadborrowed money from friends because the father was not paying support. She used the
$28,000 to repay the loans.

[60] Furthermore, in her order dated February 7, 2107, Harvison-Young J. dealt withthe issue of the $28,000. She ordered that the withdrawal is to be considered in thecontext of equalization.

[61]

This relief is denied.

Variation of the orders

[62] In summary, the variation that the father seeks is an order eliminating all supportarrears, striking the order that he pay costs and striking the order to pay spousal andchild support going forward.

[63] The father agreed to pay support on an imputed income of $60,000. The consentorder of Thorburn J. was based on this imputed income.

[64] The father claims he is unemployed and cannot afford to pay the arrears orongoing child and spousal support.

[65] If the father is unemployed as he states, nothing has changed. He describedhimself as unemployed when he consented to Justice Thorburn’s order dated July 20,2016. In his sworn July 2015 financial statement, the father stated he had no incomeand in his sworn March 7, 2017 financial statement, he states that he has beenunemployed since June 2016.

[66] Section 17(4) of the Divorce Act R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) deals with thevariation of a child support order as follows:
(4) Before the court makes a variation order in respect of a child supportorder, the court shall satisfy itself that a change of circumstances asprovided for in the applicable guidelines has occurred since the making ofthe child support order or the last variation order made in respect of thatorder.

[58] Paragraph 3 of Thorburn J.’s order requires the mother to disclose “whathappened to the $28,000 she removed from the account”. The father says that themother has not complied. The mother has complied with this order.

14 For the purposes of subsection 17(4) of the Act, any one of thefollowing constitutes a change of circumstances that gives rise to themaking of a variation order in respect of a child support order:
(a) in the case where the amount of child support includes a determinationmade in accordance with the applicable table, any change incircumstances that would result in a different child support order or anyprovision thereof;
(b) in the case where the amount of child support does not include adetermination made in accordance with a table, any change in thecondition, means, needs or other circumstances of either spouse or of anychild who is entitled to support; and
(c) in the case of an order made before May 1, 1997, the coming into forceof section 15.1 of the Act, enacted by section 2 of chapter 1 of theStatutes of Canada, (1997).

[68] The father has not satisfied the court that a change in circumstances hasoccurred since the order of Thorburn J. His motion to vary the child support order isdenied.

[69] Turning to spousal support, there is a heavy onus on the party that seeks to varya temporary spousal support order. Chappel J. summarized the test in DamaschinZamfirescu v. Damaschin-Zamfirescu, 2012 ONSC 6689 at para. 20:
The test that applies on a Motion to vary a temporary spousal supportorder has evolved within the parameters of the general principle thatparties in matrimonial proceedings should be encouraged to advance theircase to trial as soon as possible. Using this foundational principle, theOntario Court of Appeal determined in Lipson v. Lipson [[1972] 3 O.R.
403-404] that proceedings to vary interim support orders should not beencouraged. It held that in order to succeed on a Motion to change atemporary spousal support order, a party must establish that there hasbeen a substantial change in circumstances since the previous temporaryorder was made. Variation proceedings relating to temporary ordersshould not become the focus of the parties' litigation. The onus on a partywho seeks to vary a temporary spousal support order rather than waitinguntil trial is a heavy one. [Footnotes omitted]

[70] This test has been applied consistently by the court: Oxley v. Oxley, 2010 ONSC
1609, at para. 26; Biddle v. Biddle, [2005] O.J. No. 737 at para. 18; Boissy v. Boissy,

[2008] O.J. No. 2783 at para. 16; Colivas v. Colivas, 2016 ONSC 715 at para. 26.

[67] Section 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, Reg. SOR/97-175, sets outwhat constitutes a change in circumstances:

[72]
In summary, the father’s motion to vary the orders of Thorburn J. and Hood J. byeliminating support arrears and all future support is denied. For the same reasons, thereis no basis for relieving the father from paying the costs order of Harvison-Young J.
THE MOTHER’S MOTION TO STRIKE THE FATHER’S PLEADING

[73] The mother seeks an order striking the father’s pleading because he has notcomplied with the consent orders that require him to provide disclosure, he has not paidcosts and owes significant support arrears.

[74] I have already reviewed the disclosure that was ordered. While the father hasprovided some disclosure, it is very limited.

[75] The father’s excuses are hollow. The court has given the father numerousopportunities to comply with the consent orders.

[76] As Myers J. stated in Manchanda v. Thethi, 2016 ONSC 3776 at para. 4 “[e]arly,voluntary, and complete disclosure of financial information is essential to family lawproceedings.”

[77] In Roberts v. Roberts, 2015 ONCA 450, at paras 11-13 the court emphasized theimportance of disclosure:
11
The most basic obligation in family law is the duty to disclosefinancial information. This requirement is immediate and ongoing.
12
Failure to abide by this fundamental principle impedes the progressof the action, causes delay and generally acts to the disadvantage of theopposite party. It also impacts the administration of justice. Unnecessaryjudicial time is spent and the final adjudication is stalled.
13
Financial disclosure is automatic. It should not require court orders -let alone three - to obtain production.

[78] More than three orders have been issued in this case that deal with the father’snon-compliance. Justices Thorburn and Hood issued consent disclosure orders. MesburJ. noted the father’s non-compliance and extended the time to comply. The father didnot comply as noted by Harvison-Young J.

[71] The father has not met the heavy onus to justify a variation of the orders. He hasnot shown a substantial change in circumstances since the temporary support orderswere made. As explained above, nothing substantial has changed since the fatherconsented to the orders.

Our second reason is this: after continual admonitions by the courts andthe legislature that parties to a matrimonial proceeding must producefinancial documentation, willful non-compliance must be consideredegregious and exceptional. This court has stated that the most basicobligation in family law proceedings is the duty to disclose financialinformation. The requirement is immediate and ongoing: Roberts v.
Roberts, 2015 ONCA 450, 65 R.F.L. (7th) 6, at para. 11.) In 2015, FamilyLaw Rule 13 was amended to emphasize a party's financial disclosureobligations. A party's non-compliance must be considered in the context ofthis strict financial disclosure obligation. Rule 1(8) provides the court withthe authority to strike claims. Those who choose not to disclose financialinformation or to ignore court orders will be at risk of losing their standingin the proceedings as their claims or answers to claims may be struck.

[80] The father’s failure to comply with the consent court orders can no longer betolerated. The father’s non-compliance triggers rule 1(8) of the Family Law Rule, O.
Reg. 114/99. This rule gives the court the power to make any order that is necessary fora just determination, including an order striking the father’s application. It states:
(8) If a person fails to obey an order in a case or a related case, the courtmay deal with the failure by making any order that it considers necessaryfor a just determination of the matter, including,
(a) an order for costs;
(b) an order dismissing a claim;
(c) an order striking out any application, answer, notice of motion,motion to change, response to motion to change, financialstatement, affidavit, or any other document filed by a party;
(d) an order that all or part of a document that was required to beprovided but was not, may not be used in the case;
(e) if the failure to obey was by a party, an order that the party is notentitled to any further order from the court unless the court ordersotherwise;
(f) an order postponing the trial or any other step in the case; and
(g) on motion, a contempt order.

[79] As the Court of Appeal explained in Manchanda v. Thethi, 2016 ONCA 909 atpara. 13, this court has the power to strike claims in the face of non-compliance withcourt orders:

[82] The father has not defended the claims of the mother that she advanced in heranswer. To do so he had to file a reply. Family Law Rule 10(6) sates that “[a] party may,within 10 days after being served with an answer, serve and file a reply (Form 10A) inresponse to a claim made in the answer”.

[83] Although the father never filed a reply, he has been proceeding in this litigationas if he did file a reply (i.e. he challenges the support orders and requests access). Hehas never brought a motion for an order to permit the late filing of a reply. If an applicantwants to dispute claims that are set out in an answer, the applicant must file a reply.

[84] The only access order was made by Hood J. on July 20, 2016. This temporaryorder states that the father shall have access to the youngest child as arranged by theChildren's Lawyer and with that child’s input. The order also states that the father shallhave access to information about the children from “medical professionals and schools”.
There is no order that gives father access to the older child who is now 16. The motherwas ordered to use her best efforts to encourage the children to see and/or talk to theirfather. No further access orders have been issued.

[85] If the father had filed a reply, I would order that it be struck for all issues exceptcustody and access, if not resolved. Courts ought not to preclude a parent’sparticipation on issues of custody and access that involve the best interests of thechildren (see Santos v Pantelidis, 2016 ONSC 164 at para. 10).

[86] In this case custody has been resolved. The mother has a final order that givesher sole custody of the children. There is no claim for access because father has notfiled a reply.

[87] The father’s interest in pursuing access is unclear. Since the order of Hood J.
dealt with access, as if the father had filed a reply, it would be unfair and not in the bestinterests of the children, to bar his participation on this issue. Therefore, the father shallhave an opportunity to file a reply to seek access to the children. However, hisparticipation in the litigation going forward shall be limited to the access issue and willonly be permitted if he serves and files a reply no later than May 29, 2017.
CONCLUSION RE MOTIONS

[88]

In summary, I make the following orders:
(1)

The applicant’s notices of motion dated April 30, 2017 are dismissed.

(2)

The applicant’s application is struck pursuant to rule 1(8)(c) of the FamilyLaw Rules.

[81] The only pleading that the father has filed is an application for a simple divorce.
The father’s non-compliance as set out above justifies an order striking the application.
This is a just determination in the circumstances.

(3)

If the applicant wishes to file a reply to the respondent’s answer, he maydo so, but only on the issue of his access to the children. The reply shallbe served and filed by May 29, 2017 and his right to participate in thiscase shall be limited to the issue of access to the children.

(4)

If the applicant does not file a reply as permitted in (3) above, then heshall have no further right to participate in this case and the consequencesset out in rule 1(8.4) of the Family Law Rules apply as follows:
