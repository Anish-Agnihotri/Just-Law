REASONS FOR RULING ON SECTION 11(B) APPLICATION
SOSNA J.
OVERVIEW

[1]
The Applicant, John Jansen, is jointly charged with Mahyar Dadollahi-Sarab for the firstdegree murder of Ronidy Roseborough and the attempted murder of Richard Palmer. TheApplicant, Britaney Hall, is charged with being an accessory after the fact to the murder ofRoseborough.

[2]
Jansen and Hall were arrested on February 19, 2014. Dadollahi-Sarab was arrested onJuly 15, 2015. The joint trial for all three accused is anticipated to conclude on May 26, 2017.

[3]
The time between their charges to the anticipated end of trial is 39 months and 13 days.
Relying on R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, Jansen and Hall seek a stay ofproceedings. They submit the delay infringes their right to be tried within a reasonable time, aright guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

ONTARIO

[5]
After the hearing, I orally dismissed both applications with reasons to follow. Thefollowing are my reasons.
FACTS

[6]
Jansen and Palmer had known each other for over 20 years. There had been bad bloodbetween them for a number of years.

[7]
On February 12, 2014, while arguing with Palmer on the phone, Jansen advised Palmerthat he would attend at Palmer’s apartment. After the call, Palmer went down to the parking lotof his building, armed with a small baseball bat. Roseborough followed Palmer shortlythereafter. Jansen arrived in a dark SUV with at least two other males. He was armed with asmall baseball bat.

[8]
A physical confrontation took place involving the Jansen and Palmer. During the fight,Roseborough and an unknown male (alleged to be Dadollahi-Sarab) exited the SUV and becameinvolved in the fight.

[9]
During the fight, both Palmer and Roseborough were stabbed a number of times. Palmersustained serious injuries but survived; Roseborough died as result of his injuries. Following thestabbings, Jansen and Dadollahi-Sarab fled the scene in the SUV.
Jansen and Dadollahi-Sarab’s arrests

[10] Jansen was arrested on February 19, 2014 and charged with first degree murder andattempted murder. He has remained in custody since.

[11] The investigation into the unknown male’s identity continued after Jansen’s arrest.
Dadollahi-Sarab soon became a person of interest. Police investigation culminated in DadollahiSarab’s arrest on July 15, 2015. He was also charged with first degree murder and attemptedmurder. He has remained in custody since.
Hall’s arrest

[12] Hall, believed to be Jansen’s girlfriend, provided the police an audiotaped interview onFebruary 15, 2014. She stated she had not seen or talked to Jansen since before the incident. Sheadvised the police she would let them know if she heard from Jansen.

[13] On February 19, 2014, two police officers saw Hall on a public street and spoke to her.
Amongst other things, Hall advised them that she was aware that Jansen was wanted by the

[4]
Also citing Jordan, the Crown submits that any impugned delay in excess of 30 months,although presumptively unreasonable, is justified on the facts in this case. The Crown argues thatthe applications be dismissed.

[14] The police advised Hall that her apartment was a place of interest, as Jansen could behiding there. Hall expressed concerns about possibly being charged with an offense and statedthat she had a feeling that Jansen could be in her apartment.

[15] Hall attended her apartment and advised the police that Jansen was there. Jansen wasordered outside and arrested. Hall was charged with accessory after the fact to murder onFebruary 19, 2014. On consent, on March 17, 2014, Hall was released on bail.
THE JORDAN FRAMEWORK

[16] On July 8, 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada, in Jordan, directed the courts to apply anew framework when determining whether the right of an accused to be tried within a reasonabletime, as set out in s. 11(b) of the Charter, had been breached. The court established ceilingsbeyond which delay is presumptively unreasonable. For cases tried in the Superior Court ofJustice, that ceiling is 30 months. The 30-month period begins from when an accused is chargedwith an offense and ends with the actual or anticipated end of the trial: Jordan, at paras. 46-47.

[17]

The framework is as follows:
1. Calculate the total delay (i.e., the total number of months between the laying of thecharge and the actual or anticipated end of trial).
2. Deduct defence delay from the total delay to produce a net delay. Defence delay isdelay caused by the defence or delay by defence explicitly or implicitly waived by thedefence. Waivers must be clear and unequivocal. The Court observed “defenceshould not be allowed to benefit from its own delay causing conduct”: at para. 60.
The accused must fully know the right being waived and the effect that waiver willhave on those rights.
Defence actions legitimately taken to respond to the charges, however, do notconstitute defence delay: at para. 66.
3. Where the net delay exceeds the presumptive ceiling, the onus shifts to the Crown torebut the presumption of unreasonable delay by demonstrating that there areexceptional circumstances that led to the delay. If the Crown fails to rebut thepresumption of unreasonable delay, court must order a stay of proceedings.
If the net delay is below the presumptive ceiling, the burden shifts to the defence todemonstrate that the delay was nonetheless unreasonable: Jordan, at paras. 47-48, 6061, 66 and 68.

police, again that she had not seen him since before the incident, that Jansen had a key to herapartment, and she did not think the Jansen would be in the apartment.

ANALYSIS OF JANSEN’S APPLICATION
Overview of the procedural history for Jansen

[18] Jansen was charged and arrested on February 19, 2014. Evidence in a joint preliminaryhearing involving Jansen and Hall was heard on June 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, 22-25, 29-30, September14, 15, 17, 18 and November 3-5, 2015—a total of 27 days.

[19] Jansen was committed to stand trial on first degree murder and attempted murder onDecember 2, 2015. On December 22, 2015, he served a notice of application to quash the ordersof committal.

[20] On December 8, 2015, the Crown made a request to the Attorney General’s Office toproceed by direct indictment against Dadollahi-Sarab to join his charges with Jansen’s.

[21] The direct indictment joining Dadollahi-Sarab was directed on May 9, 2016. Aninformation joining Dadollahi-Sarab and Jansen was before the Superior Court of Justice on May11, 2016.

[22]

In a judicial pre-trial on June 13, 2016, Jansen abandoned his certiorari application.

[23] On July 21, 2016, pre-trial motions were scheduled for two weeks starting March 20,2017. A seven-week trial by jury was scheduled to commence April 10, 2017.
Total delay

[24] The Crown and Jansen’s counsel agree that the total delay is 39 months and 13 days. Thisexceeds the presumptive ceiling of 30 months.
Is there delay attributable to Jansen?
Joining Jansen and Hall’s preliminary hearings

[25]

Jansen denies any defence delay.

[26] On February 1, 2015, Hall’s counsel advised the Crown that Hall’s instructions hadchanged from “murder” not being an issue for her preliminary hearing to it being a live issue forcommittal on the charge of accessory after the fact to murder.

4. For cases that exceed the presumptive ceiling but were in the system before Jordanwas released, the Supreme Court of Canada directed that a “transitional exceptionalcircumstance will apply when the Crown satisfies the Court that the time the case hastaken is justified based on the parties’ reasonable reliance on the law as it previouslyexisted”: at para. 96.

[28] On June 30, 2015, the Crown and defence counsel adjourned the joint preliminaryhearing on consent to September 19, 2015. Their correspondence can be located in therespondent’s application record, tab 3, at pp. 51-52:
The Crown: The trial coordinator can make the week of September 14 th happen, butshe need to know fast.
So if we can keep all the dates in June (keeping in mind we are not sitting onFridays), then we can make this joint prelim happen. (This is assuming that Jansenis waving 11(b) to September 18th and agreeable to putting the two matterstogether for prelim). [emphasis in original]
Are we good???
Jansen’s counsel: Good for me.

[29] Jansen’s counsel thereby explicitly waived the 2.5-month delay between June 30, 2015 toSeptember 18, 2015.

[30] Jansen’s counsel submits the waiver was uninformed and invalid, because the Crownpossessed and purposely withheld material information regarding Dadollahi-Sarab’sinvestigation at the time of the waiver. I disagree for the following reasons.

[31] The Crown and defence counsel agreed that trial efficiency would be better served byholding one preliminary hearing, as the same witnesses would be called on the issue of
“murder.”

[32] When the agreement was reached on April 17, 2015, Jansen’s counsel was aware as earlyas Jansen’s first appearance in bail court on February 20, 2014 that there was an ongoinginvestigation of a third party suspect. Jansen’s counsel did not provide authorities to support hiscontention that the Crown is obligated to disclose the status of any investigation, including theinvestigation in the present matter. Such disclosure at a minimum would jeopardize, if notimperil, the investigation.

[33] I therefore find defence counsel’s unawareness of the specific details and or status of theDadollahi-Sarab investigation to be irrelevant to the unequivocal and express waiver of Jansen’ss. 11(b) rights for the 2.5 period from June 30 to September 18, 2015. At this juncture, the periodof delay is reduced to 37 months.

[27] Since the Crown would be calling the same witnesses on the issue of “murder” in bothJansen’s and Hall’s preliminary hearings, on April 17, 2015, the Crown emailed both defencecounsel to propose vacating Hall’s preliminary hearing date on May 4, 2015 and joining hercharge to Jansen’s preliminary hearing on June 1, 2015. To accommodate the dual preliminaryhearing, additional dates in September and November were added.

[34] Jansen’s counsel argues Jansen was prepared to set the earliest trial dates available. Heargues the Crown caused a 10-month delay when it exercised its discretion to prefer anindictment and charge Dadollahi-Sarab and Jansen jointly with first-degree murder andattempted murder. Counsel argues the Crown’s tactical decision ignored Jansen’s s. 11(b) rights;Jansen has remained in pre-trial detention for over three years.

[35] Jansen’s counsel contends the Crown made no effort to seek approval from the AttorneyGeneral for a preferred indictment until December 8, 2015, roughly five months after DadollahiSarab’s arrest. Counsel submits this five-month delay is compounded by the five months
(December 8, 2015 to May 9, 2016) the Attorney General took to approve the preferredindictment. Counsel submits that as a result, the Superior Court was not able to schedule pre-trialmotions and trial dates until July 21, 2016.

[36] Whether Crown ought to have sought approval to proceed by direct indictmentimmediately after Dadollahi-Sarab’s arrest on July 15, 2015 and failed to do so for five months isa red herring as to whether the delay in Jansen’s case is unreasonable. Whether the Crowncaused or waived any delays is not a consideration under the new Jordan framework. That beingsaid, there is a presumption that accused alleged to have been working in concert should be triedjointly. Joint trials satisfy a number of interests, including but not limited to: the truth seekingrole of the courts, consistent verdicts, and the public’s interest in minimizing expenses: R. v.
[37] Further, when two accused enter the system at different points in time, the Crown musttake measures to minimize the delay to the accused who entered at an earlier point in time. Onesuch tool is to prefer one or more indictments under s. 577 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46 and have the parties tried jointly.

[38] When Dadollahi-Sarab was arrested on July 15, 2015, Jansen’s preliminary hearing hadnot been completed and had been adjourned on consent to resume in September 2015. Thepreliminary hearing was highly contested. The Crown called 32 witnesses over 27 days.
Evidence and submissions were finalized on November 5, 2015. The preliminary hearing justiceadjourned the matter to December 2, 2015 at which time Jansen was committed to stand trial onfirst degree murder and attempted murder. On December 8, 2015, the Crown sought approval fora preferred indictment against Dadollahi-Sarab.

[39] The preliminary hearing itself took five months to complete. Any delay in applying forapproval from the Attorney General for a direct indictment is subsumed by the five monthsrequired to finalize the preliminary hearing.
Jansen’s certiorari application

[40] After both the Crown and defence had appeared by error on January 27, 2016 for the firstSuperior Court pre-trial, the matter was adjourned to February 10, 2016. At that pre-trial, the

Preferring an indictment for Dadollahi-Sarab

Court was advised that Jansen had filed a notice of certiorari application on December 22, 2015.
Jansen’s counsel advised he was ready to proceed with a judicial pre-trial without knowing thestatus of legal aid funding for the certiorari application. The Crown also advised the court that onDecember 8, 2015, it had requested a direct indictment to join Dadollahi-Sarab’s and Jansen’scharges. In adjourning the February 10, 2016 pre-trial to February 25, 2016, Fuerst J. concludedwith the following comments:
So, I’ve endorsed that the judicial pre-trial was commenced today. Crown counsel iswaiting for an answer from the Regional Director as to whether there will be a directindictment of a third individual. This obviously impacts on the ability of counsel andthe court to complete the judicial pretrial and set a realistic trial date. I’ve askedCrown counsel to be in a position to provide the necessary information on the nextdate, adjourned to February 25, 2016, at 2:15 p.m. to continue the judicial pre-trial.
So, it’s my wish that we be in a position to move ahead on that date: Jansen’sapplication record, tab 21, at p. 3, lines 8-20.

[41] At the February 25, 2016 judicial pre-trial, the Crown still had no answer from theRegional Director regarding approval for a direct indictment. The Court was concerned about thelack of response and ordered that a representative from the Ministry of Attorney General attendon the March 2, 2016 return date and explain the delay.

[42] On March 2, 2016, Paul Tait, a senior Crown, attended and advised that the request wasmade for a direct indictment on December 8, 2015 and forwarded to the Director of CrownOperations by January 8, 2017 for consideration. Thereafter, during the weeks of January 15, 22,29, no review was conducted, because the Director’s father died, and the Director experiencedhealth issues as result of the untimely death.

[43] Tait further advised that as of February 18, 2016, the request was in the hands of theAttorney General’s department and that a rigorous review of six to eight weeks was necessary toobtain an answer from the Ministry. The pre-trial was adjourned until March 23, 2016 for astatus report.

[44] At the March 23, 2016 pre-trial, no response had been provided regarding the request forthe direct indictment. The court was also advised that legal aid had refused funding for thecertiorari application. Counsel advised that it would appeal the legal aid decision and wanted toreserve the right to set the date for certiorari hearing. Defence counsel pressed to set trial dates inJanuary 2017. The court was not prepared to set trial dates without resolving the directindictment question, the certiorari application and for an additional reason which the courtaddressed as follows:
There may be a third counsel involved. I was told it may well be Mr. Struthers. Noone knows anything about Mr. Struthers’ schedule obviously because he hasn’t beena part of these discussions. So, I’m not undertaking that this trial is going to proceedin January of 2017 until I know who the counsel are who are involved and whether

they are all available. That’s all I can tell you that point: March 23, 2016 transcript,p. 4, lines 19-27.
The pre-trial was adjourned to April 27, 2016.

[46] On April 27, 2016, defense counsel again reiterated they were anxious to set trial dates.
The Crown advised the decision regarding the direct indictment was still pending. Addressingthe Crown, the Court expressed concern at the delay in the following exchange:
The Court: …I know, Mr. Tait, you’re aware that I really am concerned that we’removing further and further along…
Mr. Tait: Yes, yes.
The Court: …without an answer and I appreciate it’s out of your hands, but at acertain point if I don’t have an answer by May 11 th or a firm date on which an answerwill be provided, I’m going to require that the Deputy Attorney General attend inperson and it won’t be a matter for discussion…I don’t say that lightly but thismatter…has been in the Superior Court since January 27 th and we are at the end ofApril: April 27, 2016 transcript, p. 4, lines 21-32; p. 5, lines 1-8.

[47] In adjourning the pre-trial to May 11, 2016, the court also observed that to schedule trialdates, the legal aid funding status for the pending certiorari application also had to bedetermined:
The Court: Then in terms of the application, for notices of application, is there anyfurther word on that?
Lafitte [agent for Jansen’s counsel]: Still no update with Legal Aid, sorry, YourHonour.
The Court: So, similarly, we really need to know from Legal Aid what’s happeningbecause if there are now going to be certiorari applications, that impacts on myability to properly schedule trial dates as well.
Lafitte: I understand: April 27, 2016 transcript, p. 5, lines 23-32; p. 6, line 1.

[48] At the May 11, 2016 pre-trial, the court was advised that on May 10, 2016, the AttorneyGeneral had approved the direct indictment. Although defence counsel for Jansen and Hall wereanxious to set pre-trial dates, the court declined to do so for two reasons:
1. counsel for Dadollahi-Sarab’s did not attend, because legal aid funding had not beenfinalized; and2. although the defence had been advised that their appeal to fund the certiorari applications hadbeen dismissed, counsel wanted an opportunity to determine whether the applications couldbe privately funded.

[45]

[49]

In court, the following exchange took place:

Lafitte: Yes, Your Honour, so we did yesterday we received an update from LegalAid that the appeal has been refused. We haven’t received the reasons yet. They justsend it to us - to our office yesterday by mail. We would still like to - we don’t wantto abandon the application…at this point in time. We could speak to Mr. Jansen justin terms of retaining us privately to conduct a certiorari given that we just receivedthe denial yesterday, so will do that in the interim between this date and the next.
The Court: All right. So, the two certiorari applications, I’ll put to May 24th to bespoken to.

[50]

All matters were adjourned to the May 24 date to be spoken to.

[51] At the May 24 pre-trial, an agent for Dadollahi-Sarab attended, but counsel for bothJansen and Hall did not attend due to a scheduling error by the court office. The pre-trial wasadjourned to June 13, 2016. At the June 13, 2016 pre-trial, Jansen and Hall’s counsel abandonedtheir certiorari applications. Trial issues were discussed which required further review. Thematter was adjourned until July 21, 2016.

[52] On July 21, 2016, pre-trial dates were fixed for motions returnable March 20, 2017 fortwo weeks. Trial dates were fixed commencing April 10, 2017 through May 26, 2017 (sevenweeks).

[53] Ultimately, the notice of application for certiorari was withdrawn for lack of legal aidfunding. The grounds of the proposed application seeking to set aside committals to first degreemurder and attempted murder with committal on second degree murder and aggravated assaultwere never argued. Thus, this court is unable to determine the legitimacy of the application, afactor in determining whether the delay caused was or was not attributable to the defence. Theabsence of this evidence leads me infer that the application was frivolous. I cannot find,however, that the application was deliberate or calculated to cause delay.

[54] Until the notice of application for certiorari was withdrawn on June 13, 2016, the Courtwas not in a position to schedule pre-trial motion and trial dates. The Crown had advised theCourt one month earlier, on May 11, 2016, that the preferred indictment had been approved, andit was in a position to set trial dates.
After being ordered to stand trial, the appellant brought a motion to quash the committal onAugust 17, 1990. The certiorari motion was abandoned on January 10, 1991. In considering the

The Court: And the certiorari, Ms. Lafitte?

[56] I find Jansen caused the delay from May 9-June 13, 2016. During that time, the Crownand court were waiting on the status of the certiorari application. As a result, the period of delayis reduced to 36 months. This delay exceeds the presumptive ceiling of 30 months.

[57] At this stage, I make the following observation. In providing a new framework foranalysis of unreasonable delay, Jordan identified the court’s concern regarding “a culture ofcomplacency within the system towards delay”: at para. 4. All stakeholders are captured by thatcomment. The Attorney General’s review process for approval of preferred indictments isundoubtedly thorough and robust given the extraordinary nature of the order. However, inapplying the Jordan guidelines, a future review as lengthy as five months absent explanationmay be found to be symptomatic of a continued “a culture of complacency,” a situation noted inJordan to be unacceptable to both the courts and the community at large.
Exceptional Circumstances

[58] Since the net delay of 36 months exceeds the presumptive ceiling of 30 months, the onusshifts to the Crown to rebut the presumption of unreasonable delay by demonstrating that thereare exceptional circumstances that led to the delay. Exceptional circumstances are matters thatfall outside control of the Crown. These include circumstances that were reasonably unforeseenor reasonably unavoidable and which the Crown would not be able to remedy. Jordan identifieddiscrete events and particularly complex cases as being exceptional circumstances: at paras. 69,71, 75.
Complex cases

[59] Jordan held complex cases to be those that “…because of the nature of the evidence orthe nature of the issues, require an inordinate amount of trial or preparation time such that thedelay is justified.” Amongst other things, the hallmarks of a complex case include voluminousdisclosure, the number of witnesses, and proceeding jointly against multiple co-accused so longas it is in the interests of justice to do so: at para. 77.

[60] Four factors identified in Jordan as hallmarks of a complex case are present in thisapplication. I intend to deal with them individually.
Voluminous Disclosure

[61] Exhibit 1, an Agreed Statement by the Crown and defence, sets out the disclosureprovided in the Ontario Court of Justice both prior to and after Dadollahi-Sarab’s arrest on July15, 2015.

The Number of Witnesses

[66] For the purposes of committal on first degree murder and attempted murder, the Crowncalled 32 witnesses over 27 days at the preliminary hearing. The committal was vigorouslychallenged. The Crown submits it expects no fewer prosecution witnesses to be called at trial.
Proceeding Jointly against Multiple Co-Accused

[67] The prosecution of joint accused contributes to the complexity of a trial. I have alreadyfound that the exercise of the Crown’s discretion in preferring and indictment and proceedingjointly on multiple first degree murder and attempted murder charges against Jansen andDadollahi-Sarab is in the interests of justice. The third accused, Hall, is not charged with murderbut with being an accessory after the fact. All counsel agreed she too be joined in the presentindictment.
The Nature of the Issues

[68] Jordan holds that “[a] typical murder trial will not usually be sufficiently complex tocomprise an exceptional circumstance”: at para. 78. Jansen submits the present matter is a
“typical murder trial.” The evidence arises from several civilian witnesses who observed thealtercation. The central trial issue is the credibility of the complainant’s version of the event as itrelates to the question of intent prior to and during the course of the fight. Therefore, the level ofcomplexity is not such that the presumption of unreasonable delay can be rebutted by the Crown.

[69] The trial issues identified by the Crown are more complex than those submitted byJansen. Those issues include:
 Proof of the identity of the fourth male in the altercation (alleged to be Dadollahi-Sarab);
 Who actually stabbed Palmer and Roseborough, given no witnesses reported seeing a knife;
 Whether Jansen and Dadollahi-Sarab were working in concert and therefore co-perpetrators;
 Whether one was a perpetrator and the other is liable as a result of aiding and abetting; and
 Whether one was a perpetrator and the other is liable as a result of a common purpose.

[70] Jordan holds at para. 80, “[w]here the trial judge finds that the case was particularlycomplex such that the time the case is taken is justified, the delay is reasonable and no stay willissue. No further analysis is required.”

[71] The determination of a trial’s complexity falls within the trial judge’s expertise: Jordan,at para. 79. In R. v. Picard, 2016 ONSC 7061, 2016 CarswellOnt 18062, while applying theJordan framework to an application for stay of proceedings, the court found the matter to be atypical murder trial despite the case involving:
 30,000 pages of disclosure;
 2,800 photographs;
 Dozens of video recorded witness statements;
 6800 pages of cell phone records;
 25,000 text messages with content;
 103,000 lines in Excel of subscriber records from the accused’s phone;
 78 witnesses interviewed;
 60 judicial authorizations;
 Eight separate areas of expert evidence.

[72] Parfett J. held that disclosure by itself, does not indicate a complex case. She found manyof the listed witnesses would not be called at trial and that only a fraction of the text messagesand photos would be introduced into evidence. The cell phone records, judicial authorizationsand expert evidence would not be disputed. Legal issues were not novel or complicated. Therewas one accused and one charge. There was no wiretap evidence.

[73] In the present matter, the volume of disclosure, the number of witnesses for trial, thenumber of judicial authorizations and interceptions amongst other things are similar to those inPicard. However, except for being advised that the Crown expected to call the 32 witnesses, theCrown did not make submissions regarding any evidentiary admissions or matters not in disputethat would impact on the trial proceedings.

[74] Although I do not find the present matter to be a typical murder case, as Jansen contends,I also do not find it is “particularly complex”—a necessary finding, as set out in Jordan, thatrebuts the presumption of unreasonable delay. At best, I find the trial issues in this matter to bemoderately complex.
Discrete and Unexpected Events

[76] This court has already attributed delays associated with the certiorari application to thedefence.
If I am in error in that finding, the reasons provided in that analysis, are equallyapplicable to the Crown’s position that the delay caused by filing the notice of certiorariapplication is an exceptional circumstance and that the period of delay be deducted. In eithercircumstance the period of delay is reduced to 31 months and eight days.

[77] I have also considered the Crown’s submission that the period of delay is further reducedby two unanticipated events that arose during the joint preliminary hearing for Jansen and Hall.
Despite Hall’s earlier instructions on August 7, 2014, the voluntariness of her post-arreststatements was not an issue; her position changed. Voluntariness was not admitted, requiringadditional evidence from police officers and submissions as to admissibility. That added one dayto the completion of the preliminary hearing.

[78] Additionally, a Crown witness testified at the preliminary hearing she could notremember a number of events she disclosed in her audio statement regarding post offense contactshe had with Hall. This prompted the Crown to make an unanticipated application pursuant to s.
9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 and ultimately a KGB application tointroduce the statement. In totality, this discrete event added five additional days to thepreliminary hearing.

[79] The death of the Director of the Crown Operation’s father was an additional discrete andexceptional event. The Director could not review the request for a direct indictment for threeweeks starting January 15, 2017. As such, three weeks should be deducted from the net delay.

[80] These two events discrete and unanticipated totalling three weeks and six days arededucted leaving a net delay of roughly 35 months. This period of delay exceeds the 30-monthpresumptive ceiling. Given that this is a transitional case, the next step is to determine whetherthere are exceptional transitional circumstances that will justify the delay in this case.
Transitional exception

[82] Jordan further directed that the court apply a contextual and flexible assessment havingregard to “the fact that the parties’ behavior cannot be judged strictly, against a standard ofwhich they had no notice”: at para. 96.

[75] The Crown submits that the application for certiorari on December 22, 2015 (recall, itwas abandoned on June 13, 2016) is an exceptional circumstance that should be deducted.

[83] In R. v. Williamson, 2016 SCC 28, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 741, at paras. 26-30, the contextualanalysis to be applied in transitional cases is governed by the following factors:
 Complexity of the case;
 The period of delay in excess of the Morin guidelines;
 The Crown’s response if any to any institutional delay;
 Defence efforts, if any to move the case along; and
 Prejudice to the accused.

[84] In Morin, the court established that institutional delay in the range of 8 to 10 months inthe provincial court and 6 to 8 months between committal and the start of the trial in SuperiorCourt constituted an acceptable allowance for limits on institutional resources: at para. 50.

[85]
i.

[86] The delay in the Ontario Court of Justice minus any inherent time requirements,institutional delay, and defense delay was 21 months and 19 days. This is the period of time fromwhen the information was sworn on February 13, 2014 to the date of committal on December 2,2015.

[87] Jansen submits the 15 months from his arrest on February 19, 2014 to the start of thepreliminary hearing on June 1, 2015 exceed the inherent time requirements to prepare andprocess this matter. He submits the Crown failed to move the matter ahead expeditiously andminimize delay by providing timely disclosure. Numerous judicial pre-trials were held to addressoutstanding disclosure issues. In order to avoid additional delay, a preliminary inquiry date wasset prior to obtaining full disclosure. As such, the delay should not be found to be neutral timeand should be attributed to the Crown.

[88]

For the following reasons, I find no merit in Jansen’s position.

[89] Inherent time requirements cover the period required for the Crown and defence toprepare and process a case. In terms of the s. 11(b) reasonableness assessment, these inherenttime requirements are neutral and do not count against the Crown or the accused.

[90] Jansen’s first court appearance was February 20, 2014. Disclosure was sought by thedefence. On April 2, 2014, the Crown provided what it termed initial disclosure comprising ofsummaries of witness statements and police notes.

[91] On May 16, 2014, further disclosure was provided – statements from 19 civilianwitnesses and notes from 42 police officers.

[92] In the three months from Jansen’s arrest, disclosure remained a live issue in a number ofpre-trial conferences held in the Ontario Court of Justice. Although disclosure was incomplete onJune 17, 2014, 20 days were fixed for a preliminary hearing to commence June 1, 2015,approximately one year later.

[94] On October 21, 2014, significant disclosure remained outstanding. The court adjournedthe matter for further pre-trial on February 3, 2015 to review the outstanding disclosure issues.

[95] On or about November 27, 2014, the Crown provided counsel a list of 32 witnesses itintended to call for the preliminary hearing and advised it would be seeking a committal to firstdegree murder.

[96] On February 2, 2015, the defense and Crown agreed that the February 3, 2015 pre-trial toreview outstanding disclosure was to be canceled. Both agreed there was no need for furtherpre-trials and that the matter be adjourned directly to the preliminary hearing date of June 1,2015. Regarding outstanding disclosure and trial issues, defense counsel sent the following emailto the Crown:
I don’t really have much need for another judicial pre-trial. We can’t narrow theissues or witnesses given the circumstances of the case and I think we are workingwell on the disclosure front. I’m still waiting on the ITOs and you will let me knowwhat experts you intend to call: Respondent’s application record, tab 3, at p. 33.

[97] As previously reviewed, the disclosure in this matter was extensive. It was provided tothe defence as it became available. Although the timing of disclosure was a live issue canvassedin a number of judicial pre-trials, Jansen’s counsel’s e-mail to the Crown four months prior to thepreliminary hearing is inconsistent with his contention that the Crown failed to provide timelydisclosure and is thus responsible for unreasonable delay in the intake period.

[98] The e-mail is also inconsistent with Jansen’s contention that the Crown causedunreasonable delay during the intake period by failing to streamline pending trial issues. The trialissues were clear and had been identified. Jansen’s counsel’s e-mail to the Crown states, “Wecan’t narrow the issues or witnesses given the circumstances of this case.” As a result, thescheduled pre-trial to review that issue and disclosure was mutually cancelled by defencecounsel and the Crown.

[99] Jansen’s contention that Crown inaction unreasonably extended the intake period isundermined by efforts made by the Crown to seek by concessions and shorten the preliminaryhearing. In emails to Jansen’s counsel on May 9 and 25, 2015, the Crown proposed concessions,which included admission of extracted data from a third party’s phone found in Hall’s apartment,continuity of the phone after seizure, identity of the deceased Roseborough at the time of death,Jansen’s and Hall’s identification absent witnesses pointing them out in court, and the need notto call the photographer for introduction of post-mortem photos. On some issues, concessionswere made; on others, Jansen remained silent.

[93] The Crown and defence agreed that a further judicial pre-trial be set for September 29,2014 to address ongoing disclosure issues. The September 29 pre-trial was later cancelled,because the presiding justice seized with the matter was unavailable. A new date was set forOctober 21, 2014.

[100] I further find that the totality of 21 months and 19 days from the Applicant’s arrest onFebruary 13, 2014, to the completion of the preliminary hearing in the Ontario Court of Justiceon December 2, 2015 to be intake, institutional, or inherent delay and not delay caused byCrown inattention or inaction as submitted by the Applicant. In accordance with the Moringuidelines, this delay, for the most part, is neutral in determining the reasonableness of the delay.

[101] The approximate four months of intake from February 3, 2014 (first appearance) to June17, 2014 (preliminary hearing dates set) is neutral. Disclosure and trial issues reviewed atcontinuing judicial pre-trials.

[102] The almost four months between setting the preliminary hearing dates and the lastjudicial pretrial on October 21, 2014 is inherent delay and neutral. Disclosure continued to beprovided with further review at judicial pre-trials. Given the voluminous disclosure, I find theeight months of delay from February 3, 2014 to October 21, 2014, at first blush, to beproblematic but in this instance, within acceptable timelines as provided in Morin.

[103] The two months between October 21, 2014 and December 21, 2014, is the inherent timerequirement for the Crown and defense to prepare for a then estimated preliminary hearing of sixmonths.

[104] The 27 days for completion of the preliminary hearing is neutral. Prior to completion ofevidence at the preliminary hearing on November 5, 2015, as previously reviewed, the defenseexpressly waived delay for two months and 15 days from July 3, 2015 through September 18,2015. This delay period is neutral. Additionally, the one-month period from completion ofevidence at the preliminary hearing, to the return date of December 2, 2015, when applicant wascommitted to stand trial is neutral, it being inherent delay.

[105] In summary, in the Ontario Court of Justice, 21 months and 19 days elapsed from theapplicant’s arrest to committal to stand trial. This period reflected 9 months and 17 days ofinherent delay, 4 months and 4 days of intake, 5 months and11 days of institutional delay, and 2
months and 15 days of defense waiver. Having found these periods to be neutral, the amount ofinstitutional delay in the Ontario Court of Justice is approximately 5 months and 11 days. This iswell within the Morin guidelines of 8 to 10 months.

[106] The delay in the Superior Court of Justice minus any inherent requirements, institutionaldelay, and defence delay is 17 months and 24 days. This is the period from the date of committalDecember 2, 2015 to the anticipated end of the trial May 26, 2017.

[107] I find the period just over two months from Jansen’s committal to stand trial to February10, 2016 the first judicial pre-trial in which the case was addressed to be an intake period andneutral under the Morin guidelines. In those two months, the defence and filed the notice ofcertiorari application and the Crown had sought approval of to a preferred indictment againstDadollahi-Sarab.

[109] Two judicial pre-trials were held between May 11, 2016 and June 13, 2016. Theapplicant abandoned the certiorari application on June 13, 2016. I find this period of one monthto be attributable to action of the defence or “intake” both of which are neutral. The pre-trial datewas set returnable July 21, 2016. On that date pre-trial motions were fixed returnable March 20,2017, and the trial to commence April 10, 2017 through May 26, 2017.

[110] Given the complexity of the trial involving two co-accused charged with first-degreemurder and attempted murder and a third party charged with accessory after the fact, reasonablepreparation time for all counsel is no less than three months; this period being neutral. (Julythrough October 2016).

[111] Thereafter, I would ascribe five months of institutional delay from October 2016 toMarch 20, 2017, the start date of the pre-trial motions. The motions were expected to require twoto three weeks and be completed by April 7, 2007. This three-week period is neutral beinginherent delay. Similarly, the forecasted seven-week trial scheduled to start April 10, 2017 andbe completed by May 26, 2017 is neutral, being inherent delay.

[112] In the Superior Court of Justice, I ascribe 2 months and 21 days to be neutral time inwhich both Jansen’s certiorari application and the Crown’s request for approval of a preferredindictment remained unresolved. The intake period is calculated to be one month and eight days,the inherent delay (preparation time) estimated to be two to three months. The institutional delayis therefore approximately five to six months, within the Morin guidelines of six to eight months.

[113] In totality, the institutional delay in the Ontario Court of Justice (five months) andinstitutional delay in the Superior Court of Justice (five to six months) is 11 to 12 months, againwithin the Morin guidelines. This calculation has factored inherent periods of delay in providingvoluminous Crown disclosure, numerous pre-trial attendances, and trial preparation for a case ofmoderate and not simple complexity as submitted by the applicant. The approximate threemonths when both Jansen’s certiorari application and the Crown’s request for a preferredindictment remained unresolved was also a significant factor.

[114] However, the “contextual assessment” in Jordan in transitional cases includes more thanmathematical calculation of intake, preparation, and trial time. It includes how the previousframework under Morin would have been applied in relation to the seriousness of the offense.

[115] The decision in Jordan was issued in the midst of the applicants’ preliminary hearing inJuly 2016. There was no time to adapt to the new Jordan guidelines. This is a serious matterinvolving two co-accused charged with murder and attempted murder and a third party chargedwith being an accessory after the fact. There is a societal interest in a trial on the merits.
Throughout I find the Crown’s reliance on the Morin framework to be reasonable.

[108] As already reviewed, from February 10, 2016 to the pretrial on May 11, 2016
(approximately three months), Jansen’s certiorari application and the Crown’s request for apreferred indictment remained outstanding. As such, both parties were no position to set a trialdate. In applying the Morin guidelines, I find these three months to be neutral.

[117] Regarding inferred prejudice, Jansen cites the stress and anxiety of the ongoingproceedings, the uncertainty of the result, and the stigma of being subject to the court process.
With respect to actual prejudice, the applicant cites his inability to maintain close familyrelationships, living in harsh pretrial detention conditions, and significant difficulties inpreparing his case for trial.

[118] Despite the prejudice submitted, in the three years plus of detention, no application hasbeen brought for bail release.

[119] For the aforementioned reasons, I find the Crown has satisfied the court that the net timefor this case is justified based on the parties reasonable reliance on the law as it previouslyexisted. The transitional exception is applicable in this matter and Jansen’s s. 11(b) applicationto stay the proceedings is dismissed.
ANALYZING HALL’S APPLICATION
Hall’s procedural history

[120] Hall was arrested and charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder onFebruary 19, 2012. From her first appearance in the Ontario Court of Justice on February 20,2014 through March 10, 2014, Hall remained in custody without bail. On March 17, 2014, onconsent she was released on a recognizance with sureties.

[121] On April 22, 2014, the Crown proposed a possible resolution of the charge of accessoryafter the fact to murder. From that date through June 6, 2014, in three court appearances, Hall’scounsel did not respond to the proposed resolution but advised in an email to the Crown on May12, 2014 and in a court appearance on May 14, 2014, that the delay was not an issue. During thesame period, Crown had not completed its disclosure.

[122] In the next judicial pre-trial held on June 20, 2014, Hall rejected the Crown’s proposal.
Hall’s counsel also agreed that, for the purposes of disclosure, the only information sought was
“post-stabbing” disclosure, namely:
 What Hall may have known or done in harboring Jansen,
 Interviews with civilians (during the search for Jansen),
 The officer’s notes during the search for Jansen, and
 Press releases.

[116] I make this finding recognizing that Jansen has been in custody since his arrest inFebruary 2014. Jansen submits he has suffered both inferred and actual prejudice, which weighsheavily in support of a stay of proceedings when applying the Morin guidelines in a transitionalcase.

[124] On August 7, 2014, a preliminary hearing for Hall’s charge was set returnable May 4-7,11-13, 2015. It was scheduled for seven days on the understanding that:
 The fact that a murder had occurred was not an issue; and
 That a voir dire was not required for any post-arrest statements made by Hall.

[125] On February 1, 2015, Hall’s counsel advised that her instructions had changed. The factthat a murder had occurred was not admitted for the purposes of the preliminary hearing. TheCrown and Hall’s counsel agreed that the seven days for the preliminary hearing were nowinadequate.

[126] Given that a murder had occurred was at issue with the same witnesses to be called inboth Hall’s and Jansen’s preliminary hearings, the Crown and defence for Jansen and Hallagreed that a joint preliminary hearing involving Jansen and Hall would commence on June 1,2015, the date already set for Jansen’s hearing. Hall’s earlier preliminary hearing dates werevacated.

[127] The joint preliminary hearing began June 1, 2015. During the preliminary hearing, Hall’sinstructions changed further in that she was not admitting the voluntariness of her post-arrestutterances. Two police witnesses were called over three days to satisfy the voluntariness criteria.

[128] Hall was committed to stand trial on the charge of accessory after the fact to murder onDecember 2, 2015, the same day as Jansen’s committal to stand trial. Thereafter, Hall’sappearances in Superior Court mirrored those of Jansen’s.

[129] On December 22, 2015, both Hall and Jansen served notices of application for certiorarito quash the orders of committal.

[130] On June 13, 2016, Hall withdrew her application for certiorari. On July 21, 2016, thetrial dates were confirmed for both Hall and Jansen: March 20, 2017 pre-trial motions for twoweeks and then a seven-week trial by jury starting April 10, 2017.
Analysis

[131] I find the delay in this matter is below the presumptive ceiling of 30 months. I furtherfind Hall has not discharged her onus of proving that the delay is unreasonable.

[132] The total delay from the date the information was sworn on February 20, 2014 to theanticipated completion of Hall’s jury trial is 39 months and 6 days.

[133] Delay which is caused solely by the conduct of the defence is subtracted from the totaldelay.

[123] The information was to be provided by July 16, 2014, the next scheduled judicial pretrial. Disclosure for Hall’s matter was completed by that date. A further judicial pre-trial wasscheduled for August 7, 2014.

[134] I find Hall caused a delay of approximately six months. She filed a notice of applicationfor certiorari on December 22, 2015 and withdrew it on June 13, 2016. I would categorize this asdefence delay even though the Crown was seeking approval for a preferred indictment duringthis time. Given that the merits of the application were never set out or argued and given thatLegal Aid refused to fund the application, the absence of any other evidence leads me to draw aninference that the application was frivolous. I cannot find, however, that the application wasdeliberate or calculated to cause delay. Consequently, the net delay is 33 months and 15 days.

[135] I also find Hall implicitly waived approximately six months when she changed herinstructions regarding her preliminary hearing. On August 7, 2014, her preliminary hearing wasinitially scheduled for seven days, starting May 4, 2015. Hall had conceded that a murder hadtaken place at that time. She later advised, on February 1, 2015, that it was a matter to be provenfor committal on her charge of accessory after the fact—the seven days were no longersufficient.

[136] The issue then became common for both Hall’s and Jansen’s hearings, so Hall agreed tojoin her offence to Jansen’s preliminary hearing, which was scheduled to start on June 1, 2015.
The joint preliminary hearing required 27 days to present evidence. The preliminary hearing wasadjourned on consent for 2.5 months in July.

[137] The preliminary hearing was eventually completed on November 5, 2015. Hall wascommitted to stand trial on December 2, 2015.

[138] Hall argues that any delay that may have resulted because of her change in instructionsregarding the scope of the preliminary hearing not be deducted, because this would punish herfor insisting on her rights in their fullest. The Crown, after all, bears the evidential burden ofproving its case.

[139] I find the question is not whether Hall was entitled to insist on the Crown meeting itsevidential burden for committal, but whether Hall’s conduct caused or directly contributed to thedelay. Her change in instructions enlarged the scope of the preliminary hearing, increased thetime required for the completion of evidence and delayed the date of committal to December2015.

[140] Hall further submits that even if her initial preliminary hearing had been completed inMay, and she was committed to trial, her trial would remain in” abeyance until the completion ofthe Jansen matter.

[141] Hall’s second submission is conjecture at best. What might have happened had theApplicant followed through with a single issue focused preliminary hearing standing alone, isspeculative and cannot be quantified in any meaningful way. Consequently, it has no bearing ofthis Court’s assessment of the actual delay.

[143] Hall has not demonstrated that the net delay is otherwise unreasonable. Accordingly, herapplication to stay proceedings pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter is dismissed.

Sosna J.
Released: May 15, 2017

[142] As such, Hall implicitly waived the time between May 13, 2015 (the day her preliminaryhearing was initially anticipated to conclude) to November 5, 2015 (the day her joint preliminaryhearing concluded). This reduces the net delay in Hall’s case to approximately 27.5 months.
