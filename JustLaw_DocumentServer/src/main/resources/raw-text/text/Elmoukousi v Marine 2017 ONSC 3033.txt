ENDORSEMENT

[1]

The Respondent, Abdessamad Marine (the father) brings a motion for the following:
 an order setting aside the Order of Justice Tranmer dated November 22, 2016 (FinalOrder) which was obtained on default;
 an order returning the child to Quebec; and
 an order granting joint custody and equal time with the child.

[2]

The Applicant mother Fouzia Emoukoudi, opposes the motion on the basis that Mr.

Marine has not satisfied the requirements to set aside the order pursuant to Rule 25 (19)(e) of theFamily Law Rules, O. Reg. 114/99 (the “FLRs”).

[3]

For the reasons that follow, the Court sets aside the Final Order.

[4]

The issues of jurisdiction and custody/access are adjourned to a date to be determined, at

which time a full record of the evidence and authorities will be filed regarding jurisdiction and

what is in the child’s best interests.

The date for this motion must be scheduled as soon as

possible.

[5]

The parties were married in Morocco on June 18, 2013 and commenced living together in

April 2014 when Mr. Marine immigrated to Canada. They separated on March 4, 2015 and weredivorced in Morocco on July 27, 2015.

The parties had one child of the relationship Yussef

Marine born July 24, 2015.

[6]

At the time of the separation, the parties were residing in Montreal. The father had been

charged with assault and at the trial, the charges were dismissed as the mother recanted herevidence.

[7]

Sometime in 2016, the mother and the child moved to Brockville, Ontario. She indicates

that she was leaving an abusive relationship.

The father denies this abuse and alleges that, in

doing so, she was attempting to prevent him from obtaining his Canadian permanent status as shesponsored him. He alleges that she left with no notice or consent, hence abducting the child.

[8]

On August 26, 2106, the mother commenced an application pursuant to the Children’s

Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 (“CLRA”) and Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3
(“FLA”).

Service was affected on the father by personal service on September 16, 2016. Mr.

Marine did not file his materials within 30 days as required by the FLRs.

[9]

On October 6, 2016, the mother’s counsel received a letter from Quebec Legal Aid

indicating that the father would be responding to the Application. There was also a phoneconversation with mother’s counsel at which time the father was granted extra time to respond.

[10]

On November 2, 2016, the mother’s counsel sent another letter as the mother was

alleging that she was being stalked by the father.

Counsel for the mother also reminded the

father that time for his answer had elapsed. She then proceeded to obtain a date.

Background

[11]

The father did not attend the first court return date of November 14, 2016. The Court

adjourned the matter to November 22, 2016 for an uncontested hearing.
At that time, Justice Tranmer’s order indicated that the father did not appear. He ordered

the following:
 both parents are parents with the meaning of the Children’s Law Reform Act andFamily Law Act;
 the mother would have sole custody of the child;
 he would have supervised access at the Rose Garden Family Support Centre inBrockville to not more than two visits per month for up to two hours;
 commencing September 1, 2016, he would pay child support in the amount of $172
per month based on an annual income of $21,500;
 commencing November 1, 2016, he would pay spousal support in the amount of $516
per month;
 the father is required to send the “carnet famille” relating to the child to MrHammond’s office; and
 costs of $500
Father’s Position

[13]

The father states he had applied for Legal Aid and was planning to initiate proceedings in

Quebec in July 2016. On October 5, 2016, he was deemed eligible for a Legal Aid Certificate.

[14]

However, he states that the mother left Montreal in August 2016 (she states it was in

April 2016).

She left Montreal with the child, without notice or consent to move to Brockville.

He was served with the Ontario Court documents in September, 2016. They were in Englishwhich he does not read or understand. The institution of Ontario proceedings required him toapply for an inter-provincial legal aid certificate to allow him to obtain an Ontario lawyer.

[12]

[15]

Quebec Legal Aid sent the mother’s lawyer a letter dated October 6, 2016 confirming the

father would file a response within 15 days.
On November 8, 2016, the mother’s lawyer sent a letter to Quebec Legal Aid reminding

them that an answer had not been filed. There was no contact between the father, Quebec LegalAid or his lawyer until January 26, 2017 when his current lawyer contacted the mother’s counsel.

[17]

The father provided evidence to the effect that he thought the lawyer, who had been

assigned to him through legal aid, would appear for him in court at the November 2016 hearing.
His lack of attendance was not his fault and he had all intentions of asserting his rights andparticipating in the court process.

[18]

He wishes the Court to have all the evidence necessary for it to determine what is in the

child’s best interests. He also wishes the child returned to Montreal.

[19]

His current lawyer has written to his previous lawyer requesting an explanation for his

non-attendance at the November 2016 hearing but none has been forthcoming.
Mother’s position

[20]

The mother states she left Montreal in April 2016 as the father was becoming aggressive.

In addition, she was having trouble finding daycare for the child and her ability to obtain Quebecsocial services was limited.

[21]

She states that his visits with the child were sporadic. He had visits with the child on 2

occasions in April and May 2016 in Brockville. Prior to that, the visits were once a month andlasted about 30 minutes. His last visit was May 14, 2016 and he has not requested a visit sincethat time.

[22]

He has not made any inquiries regarding the child’s well-being and development nor has

he provided financial assistance.

[16]

[23]

Even after the final order, no attempts were made to contact and implement the

supervised visits he was permitted pursuant to the Final Order.
The mother is requesting an order allowing her to apply for a passport for the child and

the ability to travel outside Canada, both without the father’s consent.
The Law

[25]

Rule 25(19) of the FLRs permits the Court to set aside a court order under certain

circumstances, as follows:
(19) The court may, on motion, change an order that,
(a) was obtained by fraud;
(b) contains a mistake;
(c) needs to be changed to deal with a matter that was before the courtbut that it did not decide;
(d) was made without notice; or
(e) was made with notice, if an affected party was not present whenthe order was made because the notice was inadequate or the partywas unable, for a reason satisfactory to the court, to bepresent. O. Reg. 151/08, s. 6.

[26]

The father is proceeding under Rule 25(19)(e) of the FLRs. In Magri v. Cellupica, 2014
The word “unable” in 25(19)(e) should be given a broad interpretation inaccordance with the spirit of this rule. Ms. Magri had a lawyer who was on therecord and therefore an officer of the court with respect to this matter. A clientwho is advised by his or her lawyer not to attend court should be able to rely onthat advice. To require clients to attend court in spite of their lawyer’s advicewould lead to absurd results.

[27]

analysis which was fact driven.

In that case, he accepted the Applicant’s explanation for not

attending and that she was self-represented and of limited income.

intended to respond.

She was also confused

In addition, the Respondent knew that the Applicant

[24]

Decision

[28]

The Court finds that:

initiate his own proceedings;
 he immediately took steps to obtain legal aid;
 upon being served, he made arrangements to obtain an intra-provincial certificate;
 there were challenges and delays because it was an extra-provincial application;
 he honestly thought the Ontario lawyer assigned to him would attend in November;
 after being served with the default Order, he continued to pursue his rights byretaining his current lawyer;
 the father immediately retained his current lawyer who wrote to the mother’s lawyerin January 2017;
 he moved for an order to set aside the Final Order when it became clear that themother would not consent to an order; and
 he was served with documents in the English language that provided some challengesto him.

[29]

It should be noted that the mother’s application did proceed through the courts in an

expeditious matter. Within 60 days of service, the mother was able to obtain a motion for trialon an uncontested basis.

The father being an out-of-town litigant, unilingual and without funds,

was at the mercy of the legal aid plan and had challenges in securing legal counsel. On top ofthis, the lawyer assigned to him through legal aid process did not attend court in November 2016
when the father was under the impression he would be there.

[30]

The mother represented that the child has medical issues.

No evidence was provided

regarding the details or the needs of the child and how each parent can meet those needs. A full

 the father intended to deal with the issues of the separation as he was planning to

motion is needed to deal with parenting. The Court will also require jurisprudence with respectto the jurisdictional issue.
The mother is entitled to her costs thrown away.

If the parties cannot agree on the

quantum, I will receive a 2-page submission with a bill of costs from the mother by June 16,2017 and the father’s 2-page submission by June 23, 2017.
