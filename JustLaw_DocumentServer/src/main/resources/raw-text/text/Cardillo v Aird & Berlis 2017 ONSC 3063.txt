DIAMOND J.:

[1]
On this motion, the respondent seeks a declaration that three Releases signed by theapplicants as part and parcel of various agreements (to be defined hereinafter) forever precludethe assessment of various legal accounts rendered by the respondent to Sun Life AssuranceCompany of Canada (“Sun Life”).

[2]

A brief summary of the relevant facts on this application is as follows:
●

On or about October 13, 2006, Sun Life entered into a Loan Agreement with theapplicant Medcap Real Estate Holdings Inc. (“Medcap”, formerly known asCardillo Corp.). The loan was secured with (a) a mortgage over real property, (b)
a general security agreement and (c) a personal guarantee signed by the coapplicant John Cardillo (“Cardillo”).

ONTARIO

●

By late January 2016, Medcap was indebted to Sun Life in the aggregate of over
$1,500,000.00 (inclusive of principal, interest, realty taxes, fees, interests andcosts). Pursuant to Clause 14(c) of the Loan Agreement, Medcap (and Cardillo asguarantor) had agreed to pay all of Sun Life’s legal costs relating to the loanincluding any and all enforcement or realization costs.

●

The respondent was retained by Sun Life to take necessary steps to enforce thesecurity and collect the amounts due under the Loan Agreement. On February 1,2016, Sun Life entered into a Forbearance Agreement with the applicants whereinthe parties agreed that the total amount owed to Sun Life included, inter alia, therespondent’s legal fees incurred to date.

●

Pursuant to Clause 2.1(b) of the Forbearance Agreement, the applicantsacknowledged, confirmed and agreed that the amounts due to Sun Life, includingthe respondent’s legal fees, were “unconditionally owing…without any right ofset off, defence, counterclaim or reduction of any kind, nature or descriptionwhatsoever”, and that each of the applicants were “estopped from disputing” theamount owing.

●

Pursuant to Clause 6.3 of the Forbearance Agreement, the applicants covenantedand agreed to reimburse Sun Life for all reasonable expenses, including withoutlimitation “actual legal and other professional expenses” that Sun Life hadincurred or would incur arising out of its dealings with the applicants and in thepreservation and enforcement of Sun Life’s security, including without limitationthe respondent’s actual fees and expenses.

●

Pursuant to Clause 8.6 of the Forbearance Agreement, the applicants released SunLife and its “attorneys, advisors and other representatives” (i.e. the respondent)
from any and all demands, actions, causes of action, suits, covenants, sums ofmoney, accounts, bills, damages and claims, counterclaims or demands in anyway in connection with the Forbearance Agreement or the Loan Agreement.

●

The deadline for the applicants to pay the amount due to Sun Life wassubsequently extended from February 23, 2016 to March 4, 2016 pursuant to aForbearance Extension Agreement. Clause 10 of the Forbearance ExtensionAgreement contained a further, second Release from the applicants in favour ofSun Life and the respondent in essentially the same terms as the Release set out inclause 8.6 of the Forbearance Agreement.

●

Contemporaneous with payment of the amounts due to Sun Life, the partiesentered into an Assignment Agreement dated March 4, 2016, which assigned theLoan Agreement and underlying security to 2503866 Ontario Ltd. (“250”).
Schedule “A” to the Assignment Agreement set out a summary of the totalindebtedness owed to Sun Life, which amount included $89,065.68 of legal fees

and disbursements (part and parcel of the principal balance owing under the LoanAgreement) and further legal fees and disbursements incurred in connection withenforcement efforts. That Schedule further indicated that the said amounts didnot “include any future costs of whatever nature in time that may be incurred bySun Life to bring the matter to a close…and all such future costs shallunconditionally be included in the final mortgage payout statement.”
●

Pursuant to Clause 11 of the Assignment Agreement, the applicants executed athird Release in favour of Sun Life and the respondent using, essentially, the sameterms set out in the first two Releases.

●

The applicants had an opportunity to review and consider the terms of theAssignment Agreement and to obtain independent legal advice in respect of same.
There is no dispute that the applicants executed the Assignment Agreement (andfor that matter all previous Agreements) voluntarily.

●

The respondent issued a total of four accounts to Sun Life. All of the accountswere ultimately paid to Sun Life by April 14, 2016.

●

On July 16, 2016, the applicants obtained a Registrar’s Order which required theproduction and assessment of the respondent’s accounts relating to theenforcement of the Loan Agreement and underlying security. The Registrar’sOrder was delivered to the respondent on July 18, 2016.

●

In response to being served with the Registrar’s Order, the respondent advised theapplicants that the respondent took the position that the three executed Releasesprecluded any assessments of the respondent’s accounts, and that if the applicantsinsisted upon proceeding with the assessment, the respondent would bring amotion to strike out the assessment.

●

On August 8, 2016, the applicants advised the respondent of their position that theReleases were contrary to the relevant jurisprudence and were unenforceable.
The respondent did not take any steps at that time to bring its contemplatedmotion to strike, nor did the respondent produce the accounts requested by theapplicants as per the terms of the Registrar’s Order.

●

On or about November 7, 2016, the applicant served a motion returnable January16, 2017. That motion sought an order finding the respondent in contempt of theRegistrar’s Order, and a term permitting the respondent to purge its allegedcontempt by complying with the Registrar’s Order within 10 days.

●

In response to the applicants’ motion, the respondent advised that it wouldprovide the accounts “on a without prejudice basis to its position that theapplicants are not entitled to an assessment of the accounts”. The respondent then

●

The parties attended before Justice Matheson on January 16, 2017 to argue theissue of costs. Justice Matheson released a brief Endorsement which stated:
“The only real issue is costs. Bearing in mind all submissionsregarding costs, I order that the respondent pay $500.00 for costs.”

●

On February 1, 2017 a preliminary appointment was held before an assessmentofficer. The assessment was scheduled to proceed on June 6-7, 2017 subject tothe possibility that those dates would be vacated if the respondent was successfulon the within motion.

[3]
On their face, the three Releases preclude the applicants from proceeding with anassessment of the respondent’s accounts. The applicants opposed the relief sought on thismotion on two primary grounds:
(a)

the three Releases (and the various governing clauses in the ForbearanceAgreement, Forbearance Extension Agreement and Assignment Agreement) areunenforceable as they amount to contracting out of the protections provided in theSolicitors Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. S.15, and

(b)

the respondent is precluded by reason of the doctrines of res judicata or issueestoppel from striking out the Registrar’s Order as they ought to have done sobefore Justice Matheson on January 16, 2017.

[4]“The case law supports the respondent's position that a client cannotcontract out of the protections in the Solicitors Act for reasons of publicpolicy. For example, this court has held that an agreement to raise anydisputes concerning accounts within 15 days as opposed to the 30 daysprovided for under the Act was held to be unenforceable: Javornich v.201 (C.A.). Similarly, in Andrew Feldstein & Associates Professional Corp.5704 (ON CA), 47 O.R. (3d) 641, [2000] O.J. No. 1102 (C.A.), at para. 14,

forwarded the accounts to the applicants on that basis, and the only outstandingissue left for the Court to determine on the applicants’ motion was that of costs.

Doherty J.A. quoted a passage from the judgment of Adams J. in Borden &O.R. (3d) 352, [1993] O.J. No. 1946 (Gen. Div.), at pp. 357-58 O.R., to theeffect that the legal profession's monopoly status, coupled with theobligations on the profession in the Solicitors Act, make it clear that therendering of legal services is not simply a matter of contract. He rejected thesubmission that an agreement between a client and a lawyer could precludethe client from resorting to the Solicitors Act or the inherent power of thecourt to conduct an assessment of the lawyer's fees.”

[5]
In Jean Estate, a solicitor and his client agreed to have their contiguity fee disputedetermined by an arbitrator rather than an assessment officer as provided for in the Solicitors Act.
The Court of Appeal expressly held that for public policy reasons, the parties were precludedfrom contracting out of the statutory protections contained in the Solicitors Act. Those publicpolicy concerns are premised upon the inherent powering imbalance between a solicitor andhis/her client, as a client may not always be cognizant of his/her rights due to the potentialvulnerability found within the relationship.

[6]
In the case before me, the applicants were at all material times represented by counsel,and there was no solicitor/client relationship between them and the respondent. The applicantswere and remain sophisticated commercial parties.

[7]
Neither the applicants nor the respondent were ever seeking to contract out of theSolicitors Act. On the contrary, they negotiated a term in the Forbearance Agreement (and boththe Forbearance Extension Agreement and the Assignment Agreement) which ensured that inconsideration of the forbearance itself, the applicants would be forever precluded fromquestioning, challenging or avoiding payment of the indebtedness owed to Sun Life. Thatindebtedness included the respondent’s legal fees, which were of course an expense that theapplicants were required to pay pursuant to the original Loan Agreement.

[8]
There is no doubt that Sun Life, and in turn the respondent, relied upon the inclusion andexecution of the three Releases as part of Sun Life’s decision to hold off on its enforcementefforts.

[9]
In my view, the rationale behind Jean Estate is not present here. The Releases form partof a series of commercial transactions between two sophisticated parties. The applicants had thebenefit of independent legal advice, something which the client in Jean Estate never had. TheForbearance Agreement, the Forbearance Extension Agreement and the Assignment Agreementare, effectively, evidence of a settlement of Sun Life’s potential claims upon the loan. This is nota case where the respondent issued an account for services rendered to the applicants. On thecontrary, this is a case where the applicants agreed to pay the respondent’s fees, somethingwhich the applicants had already agreed to do under the original Loan Agreement. In otherwords, payment of the respondent’s fees was a prior, existing obligation on the part of theapplicants in its original contractual arrangements with Sun Life.

I therefore reject the applicants’ first ground of opposition to the respondent’s motion.

[11] Dealing with the issues of res judicata and issue estoppel, the applicants submit therespondent’s motion is, in effect, an abuse of process as the respondent is attempting to litigatethe same issues that were or ought to have been placed before Justice Matheson. In particular,the applicants submit that the validity of the Registrar’s Order was an issue that could (andshould) have been raised before Justice Matheson on January 16, 2017.

[12] In a related submission, the applicants also argue that by failing to bring a cross-motionbefore Justice Matheson on January 16, 2017, and subsequently participating in the preliminaryassessment for the Registrar, the respondent has “attorned” to the jurisdiction of the assessmentand is now estopped from challenging the Registrar’s Order.

[13] I disagree.
When the respondent delivered the requested accounts, they had anindependent obligation to do so in any event. The applicants had purchased the indebtedness andwere entitled to production of the accounts over and above the terms of the Registrar’s Order.
However, the respondent made it clear that in the context of the pending assessment, theaccounts were being delivered on a without prejudice basis as the respondent reserved its right tobring the within motion to strike out the Registrar’s Order and the assessment.

[14] The issue as originally framed on the applicants’ motion before Justice Matheson waswhether the respondent was in contempt of the Registrar’s Order. That issue was never arguedbefore Justice Matheson, as the parties agreed to focus solely upon both entitlement and quantumof costs of the applicants’ motion. The applicants were aware well prior to the service of theirmotion of the respondent’s position that the Releases precluded the Registrar’s Order andassessment. I do not find that the respondent ever “acquiesced” to the validity of the Registrar’sOrder or the applicants’ purported right to proceed with an assessment. What the applicantsoriginally sought on their motion before Justice Matheson was, in reality, production of theaccounts.
They received those documents, and based upon Justice Matheson’s briefEndorsement, were apparently entitled to payment of their associated nominal costs.

[15] I do not find that the issue of the validity of the Registrar’s Order was joined, or neededto be joined, at the return of the applicants’ motion before Justice Matheson. As such, thedoctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel do not apply.

[16] I therefore reject the applicants’ second grounds in opposition to the respondent’s motion,and grant the relief sought by the respondent on its motion.
Costs

[17] With respect to costs, the respondent was the successful party on its motion, and there isno reason to depart from the general rule that costs ought to follow the event. I have reviewedthe Bills of Costs submitted by both parties. The applicants submit that some of the time chargedby the respondent was duplicated as a result of the respondent’s failure to bring a cross-motion

[10]

For the reasons given above, I have already

[18] In my view, and the circumstances of this case, having reviewed the hours and ratescharged by the respondent, I award the respondent its costs of the motion payable by theapplicants on a partial indemnity scale in the all-inclusive amount of $7,500.00.
