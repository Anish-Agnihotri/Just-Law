DIVISIONAL COURT FILE NO.: 186/16
DATE: 20170519

5. On March 5, 2013, Ms. Hsieh attended at the ODSP office to further review hereligibility.
At that meeting, she disclosed that she owned her residence mortgage-free,had income of $540.67 per month from CPP-D and she had sold the investments of
$183,257.43.
Following that meeting, on April 15, 2013, ODSP received variousdocuments from two financial institutions indicating that Ms. Hsieh held a securitiesportfolio with foreign equities and mutual funds in excess of US$250,000 in each of2010, 2011 and 2012.
6. On May 27, 2013 the ODSP caseworker was advised by a third financial institution thatMs. Hsieh was in receipt of an annuity of approximately $1300 per month during 2010,2011 and 2012 (which had been deposited into an undisclosed bank account) and that thepolicy had terminated in January 2013.
7. On the basis of Ms. Hsieh’s failure to disclose assets in excess of the prescribed limit, theDirector terminated her benefits effective March 1, 2013 and established an overpaymentin the amount of $22,852.79.
8. Ms. Hsieh requested an internal review of the termination decision and of theoverpayment decision. In a letter dated April 25, 2013 the ODSP Caseworker advisedthat the termination of benefits decision was confirmed. In a letter dated July 4, 2013
Ms. Hsieh was advised that her request to review the overpayment decision was deniedon the basis that she had made the request after the deadline for submitting the requestand the reasons for late filing were not sufficient.
9. Ms. Hsieh appealed the termination of her benefits decision and the overpaymentdecision. The Social Benefits Tribunal held a hearing on July 16, 2014 and adjournedfor further disclosure from the Director. The hearing was held on May 21, 2015. TheMember observed that Ms. Hsieh had not requested an internal review of theoverpayment decision within the prescribed time but, for reasons indicated, the Memberheard both appeals and, in a decision dated August 12, 2015, the appeals were bothdismissed.
10. Section 31(1) of the ODSP Act provides a right to appeal the Tribunal decision within 30
days to the Divisional Court on a question of law. Ms. Hsieh did not appeal the decisionof the Tribunal.
11. On April 20, 2016, Ms. Hsieh started this Notice of Application for Judicial Review.
12. The Notice of Application indicates that she seeks judicial review of both of the decisionsof the Tribunal but in her oral submissions, she appeared to acquiesce in the terminationof benefits decision and she focused on the overpayment decision. We note however thatthe overpayment decision is based on the same facts as the termination decision.
13. Judicial review is a discretionary remedy that is not available where the applicant has anadequate alternative remedy. Harelkin v. University of Regina [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561

14. In a letter dated May 12, 2017 addressed to the Divisional Court Ms. Hsiehacknowledged that she had not appealed from the decision of the Tribunal and sheprovided her explanation as to why she ought to be permitted to pursue the judicialreview application.
15. As indicated above, Ms. Hsieh is familiar with the ODSP administration and adjudicativestructure:
she applied for benefits and, as the record indicates, she applied for otherrelated benefits; she provided documents and information to the ODSP; she was requiredto attend on two occasions for an eligibility review; she was informed that her benefitswere terminated; she was told that she would be required to pay back all the benefits shehad received; she requested an internal review of the overpayments decision which wasdenied; she requested and received an internal review of the termination of benefitsdecision which served to confirm the original decision; she appealed to the Tribunal fromboth decisions; she asked for reconsideration of the Tribunal decision which was denied.
She then launched this application for judicial review.
16. In her written submissions including the Notice of Application, her factum, her letterdated May 12, 2017 and in her oral submissions, Ms. Hsieh has listed many complaintsincluding: she did not apply for ODSP but the caseworker did it when Ms. Hsieh went toinquire about employment; she told the caseworker about her income and assets and shedid not fail to disclose; the caseworker did not ask her enough questions; she never got anexplanation from the Tribunal as to why her appeal was not successful; she has disposedof the assets that she had or she was not the owner of assets even though they were in hername (which latter fact was not accepted by the Tribunal); she has significant debtsincluding OSAP and she cannot afford to pay the overpayment; the caseworker exceededher authority in making inquiries of financial institutions; she had trouble communicatingwith her caseworker and when there was communication, it was unsatisfactory.
17. Ms. Hsieh firmly believes that she provided all the necessary disclosure in a timely wayand she firmly believes that she has answered truthfully to all ODSP inquiries.
Nevertheless, none of her complaints provide any exceptional circumstances whichjustify this court hearing the application for judicial review when Ms. Hsieh did not availherself of the statutory appeal. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.
ORDER TO GO AS FOLLOWS:
18. The Application for Judicial Review of the decision of the Social Benefits Tribunal datedAugust 12, 2015 is dismissed without costs.
