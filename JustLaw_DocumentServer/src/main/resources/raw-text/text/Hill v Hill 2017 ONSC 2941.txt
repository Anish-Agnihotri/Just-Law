In writingCOSTS ENDORSEMENT

[1]

Each part has now filed costs submissions on the motions heard on

March 13, 2017. Mr. Hill seeks costs on a substantial indemnity basis in theamount of $8,315 for fees, $257.25 for disbursements and HST for a total of
$9,686.87. He claims entitlement to these costs because he submits the resultsof those motions closely mirror his offer to settle. He suggests those costs can bepaid from the share of Ms. Hill’s proceeds of sale when the matrimonial home issold.

[2]

Ms. Hill takes a different approach. She submits that although the results

success on the motions. Ms. Hill seeks costs based on fees of $4,975 plus HST
totalling $5,621.29 on a partial indemnity basis, or $6,965 for fees and HST
totalling $7,870.45 for costs on a substantial indemnity scale. She makes thesubmission that she had no choice but to bring her motion, and that the resultrelating to child based issues was decided in accordance with the terms an offershe had made before the motion was heard.
Principles

[3]

When it comes to assessing the appropriate amount for costs, the

authorities have mandated certain fundamental principles for the court toconsider when making a costs award.

[4]

First, Fong v. Chan (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330 (Ont. C.A.) sets out the

three fundamental objectives that the modern costs rules are designed to serve:
a. To partially indemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation;b. To encourage settlement; andc. To discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants.

were somewhat mixed, she should be awarded costs as she enjoyed greater

[5]

Second, it is a fundamental principle in the law of costs that the court

what is fair and reasonable is generally considered to be what amount theunsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay for those costs: Boucher v.
Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario et al, [2004] 71 O.R. (3rd)
291.

[6]

I am also guided by Family Law Rule 18 when an offer to settle has been

served, for the purpose of determining the successful party and therefore theparty presumptively entitled to costs under Family Law Rule 24(1), and as to theproper basis for recovery. If a party is considered the successful party on themotion and has achieved a result on the motion equal to or more favourable thanhis or her offer, it could make the difference between receiving an award of costsat a lower level, and making a full recovery of costs.

[7]

Mr. Hill achieved success on obtaining an order containing terms

consistent with his offer to settle. However, the court declined to grant summaryjudgment on issues of custody and access for Paula Jamieson, or even sharedcustody on a temporary basis. This alone takes his offer out of contention for fullrecovery of his costs under Family Law Rule 18(14).

should only grant what is a fair and reasonable amount for costs. A measure of

[8]

The offer served by Ms. Hill was not as favourable as the result on her

Jamieson, or on her issue of exclusive possession or Mr. Hill’s motion to list thematrimonial home for sale.

[9]

I find in all the circumstances, including the offers to settle, that Mr. Hill

was the successful party. As such, he is entitled to the costs of the motion fixedin the amount of $6,500, all inclusive.

[10]

This amount is fair and reasonable as it is approximately what Ms. Hill

was seeking as a mid-range for costs. It is also an amount that reflects theobjectives of the modern objectives for awarding costs in Fong v. Chan.

[11]

The sum of $6,500 awarded to Mr. Hill may be paid out of Ms. Hill’s share

of the proceeds of sale when the matrimonial home is sold, or if she purchaseshis interest, at the time of closing.
