During the marriage, Mr. Sutton suffered reverses in his woodworking

business.

After a bankruptcy and termination of a partnership, he became a

approximately $136,151.04 in 2015 plus benefits of $11,879.46.

Ms. Sutton also

suffered health problems during the marriage, for which she was given medicalleaves of absence from her employment as a teacher and, a year after theparties’ separation, early retirement. She received income of approximately
$39,000 in 2015.

[3]

Since their separation, each of the parties has formed a relationship with a

new partner. Mr. Sutton and his spouse now live in Ontario. Since the summer of2011, Ms. Sutton has lived in Portugal, on a farm owned by her spouse’s elderlyfather, returning to Ontario several times a year to visit family.

[4]

Mr. Sutton began the present proceeding in 2015, 4.5 years after the

parties separated. A trial of the proceeding has yet to be scheduled.

[5]

Ms. Sutton moves for interim spousal support and further financial

disclosure from Mr. Sutton. The parties delivered conflicting affidavits, and didnot cross-examine each other on them. Ms. Sutton asks that her motion beallowed and Mr. Sutton asks that it be dismissed.

[6]

It is undisputed that Mr. Sutton’s current income is more than three times

Ms. Sutton’s income. Based on an online article on retiring in Portugal, Mr.Sutton argues that the cost of living in that country is low, and that Ms. Suttondoes not require financial support from him. Ms. Sutton submits that she isentitled to support from Mr. Sutton, which he is able to provide, and that sheshould not be disadvantaged by the fact that she is living within her reducedmeans.

BACKGROUND FACTS

[7]

The parties married on August 16, 1975, when both were students at

have three grown children, born in 1978, 1982, and 1990, who were 32, 28, and20 years old, respectively, when the parties separated.
Mr. Sutton’s Means and Circumstances

[8]

Ronald Sutton operated a woodworking business in Ridgetown, Ontario,

from 1977 to 1980.

In 1980, the building in which the business operated was

destroyed by a fire, and an investigation disclosed that the fire was caused byarson. A dispute arose between Mr. Stutton’s Bank, which had made acommercial loan to the business, which Mr. Sutton had personally guaranteed,and the business’ insurer, which resulted in the Bank calling its loan andenforcing Mr. Sutton’s Guarantee. As a result, Mr. Sutton claimed bankruptcyand the Bank seized his assets.

[9]

Mr. Sutton made an assignment to the Bank of his rights to the insurance

proceeds.

Ultimately,

the Bank and the insurer

settled,

Mr.

Sutton was

discharged early from his bankruptcy, and some of his personal assets, includingvehicles, tools and a boat, were returned to him.

[10]

Beginning in 1979, Mr. Sutton was employed as a production manager at a

woodworking business in British Columbia. Ms. Sutton and their first child movedto B.C. with him, and a second child was born in B.C. Ms. Sutton contributed tothe family’s income by working as an interpreter in court and at immigrationhearings.

[11]

The Suttons were in B.C. for three years, until 1982. Mr. Sutton says that

they returned to Ontario because Ms. Sutton’s mother, who lived in Ontario, had

Waterloo University. They separated 35 years later, on October 4, 2010. They

cancer.

Ms. Sutton denies that this was the cause of their returning to Ontario.

She says that Mr. Sutton quit or lost three jobs in woodworking companies in

further employment there.

She says that her mother was diagnosed with cancer

in 1978, before they moved to B.C., and did not die of the disease until 1989,seven years after their return to Ontario.

[12]

Mr. Sutton became a licensed carpenter in 1981, the year before their

return to Ontario.

He was unable to secure employment in the Ridgetown area,

and therefore became a partner in a woodworking business in 1982, with
$12,000 borrowed from Ms.

Sutton’s brother-in-law,

Brian Anderson. The

economy was poor, and the business closed in 1988. All the partners, includingMr. Sutton, lost their capital investments, and Mr. Sutton additionally lost thetools of his trade.

[13]

When Mr. Sutton’s business closed in 1988, Mr. and Ms. Sutton decided to

return to school to complete their educations. They were both accepted atWaterloo University, but it was necessary for one of them to work while the otherattended school. Mr. Sutton found work as a supervisor at Stahle ContractorsLtd. in Waterloo, and the parties bought a home there in December 1988 with theproceeds of sale of their home in Ridgetown and help from Ms. Sutton’s brother.

[14]

Mr. Sutton worked at Stahle from 1988 to 1992. By then, Ms. Sutton had

obtained her degree in languages at Waterloo in 1990, completed her 7 monthsof teacher training at the University of Toronto in 1992, and secured full-timeemployment as a teacher with the Chatham Kent Separate School Board, whereshe had been employed part-time since September 1990, three months aftertheir third child was born on June 4, 1990. She also continued to run the family’scorn detasseling business during the summers from 1982 to 2005.

[15]

In 1992, when Ms. Sutton secured full-time employment with the School

Board, Mr. Sutton left his employment at Stahle and returned to school himself,

Wilfred Laurier University in 1994.

[16]

Ms. Sutton says that from 1992, when Mr. Sutton returned to school, until

2000, six years after he graduated, Mr. Sutton obtained and quit or lost five jobs,two in Kitchener, one in Hanover, one in South Dakota, and the other inWinnipeg, Manitoba, interspersed with periods of unemployment. From 1994,when Mr. Sutton graduated, Ms. Sutton cared for the children, then aged 4 to 16,and the family’s home, and Mr. Sutton worked away from home for up to a monthat a time.

In 2000, Mr. Sutton formed a corporation, 200023 Ontario Inc., in which he

held 51% of the shares and Ms. Sutton held 49%.

Sutton entered into partnership with 3 others at Stahle

Contractors Ltd. to provide consulting services to woodworking businesses inWinnipeg, Kitchener, and South Dakota. The partnership lasted until 2001, whenthe majority partner forced a buy-out of Mr. Sutton’s interests. Litigation ensued,in which Mr. Sutton incurred legal costs of $65,000, which was later reduced to
$40,000 when he had his lawyer’s accounts assessed.

[18]

In 2003, Mr. Sutton’s company took over a business, More Than Lumber

Contracting, which the parties’ son, Carlo, then 22, had formed in Waterloo in2000, and Mr. Sutton changed the company name to MTL Contracting Ltd.
(“MTL”). Mr. Sutton says that Ms. Sutton was a shareholder, officer, and directorof MTL, and a co-signor for its two loans.

Ms. Sutton asserts that she was a

partner in name only, and was not actively involved in the business, other than

completing his B.A. degree at Waterloo University in 1993, and his M.B.A. at

[19]

In 1995, Mr. and Ms. Sutton borrowed $85,000 and purchased a lot at

Miller Lake. Mr. Sutton began building a cottage on the property in 2003, hesays, with a gift of $15,000 from his father and, during construction, withmortgage financing.

Ms. Sutton says that Mr. Sutton insisted on purchasing and

developing the property into a 3,000 square foot house that the family could notafford, which drained their resources. Mr. Sutton moved to the Miller Lake homein 2004. Ms. Sutton continued to reside at the home in Waterloo with theiryoungest child, Christina, then 14 years old.

[20]

In 2007, Mr. Sutton agreed to renovate a cottage property that belonged to

Ms. Sutton’s brother in law, Brian Anderson, and his wife Marie, Ms. Sutton’ssister. This project ended in conflict, when Mr. Sutton required $78,000 which Mr.Anderson was unable to pay, and when Mr. Sutton was diagnosed with cancer,requiring surgery, and was advised to avoid strenuous work for at least sixweeks.

[21]

In 2009, the Suttons sold their home in Waterloo, according to Ms. Sutton,

because they were unable to maintain both the home and the Miller Lakecottage. Ms. Sutton and Christina moved to an apartment in Waterloo, wherethey lived during the week while Ms. Sutton worked at the School Board, andcommuted to the cottage for the weekends.

[22]

Mr. Sutton says that after Ms. Sutton separated from him in October 2010,

he earned no income from 2010 to 2014, and when Ms. Sutton took earlyretirement in 2012, he was unable to maintain the Miller Lake property, and theBank moved under Power of Sale to have the property sold.

translator in court, and ran the family’s corn detasseling business duringsummers.

[26]

After Mr. Sutton’s business failed in 1979 and he declared bankruptcy, the

parties moved to British Columbia, where they lived from April 1979 to July 1982.

[28]

Ms. Sutton says that she contributed a significant portion of her earnings

from teaching and from the detasseling business to Mr. Sutton’s businesses.
Additionally, she says that by 1993, she was single-handedly caring for thechildren. Mr. Sutton acknowledged that she made shareholder loans totaling
$70,000 to MTL.

[29]

While acknowledging that Mr. Sutton issued 49% of the shares of MTL to

her, and named her as secretary of the business in the incorporating documents,Ms. Sutton states that she was never actively involved with the business, exceptfor lending money to it from time to time “to keep it afloat.”

She says that she

had no signing authority and did not receive any money directly from thecompany. While she occasionally ran errands or cleaned up job sites, she says,she did not make decisions regarding the operation of the business and had nocontact with its customers.

[30]

Ms. Sutton says that in the latter part of the marriage, as a result of the

family’s financial problems, which she attributes to Mr. Sutton’s reckless overspending and inability to maintain steady employment, his conflict with Ms.Sutton’s brother-in-law, and his emotional abuse of her, Ms. Sutton becameburned out and could no longer cope.

She had difficulty sleeping, lost weight,

and suffered from anxiety and panic attacks.

Increasingly, she was unable to

perform her job.

For a year after the parties separated, Ms. Sutton’s pay continued to be

deposited directly into the parties’ joint bank account, from which both partieswithdrew funds to pay their household bills, including the mortgage on the MillerLake cottage.

Ms. Sutton resumed work but took sick leave again from March 7

to 20, 2011, and from April 11 to 25, 2011. After resuming work in September2011, she took another sick leave until November 20, 2011, and then an unpaidleave until October 2012. Her medical leaves were supported by her familydoctor, and her Principal and Teachers’ Union eventually advised her to takeearly retirement, which she did on October 21, 2012.

The parties’ assetsIn 1988, the parties bought their home in Waterloo for $148,000 with the

proceeds of sale of their home in Ridgetown.

Mr. Sutton built an addition, the

cost of which he estimates was $45,000. They sold the home in 2009 for
$299,000, using the net proceeds of $90,000 to re-pay debt and buy a lot onwhich MTL stores equipment. That property is still owned by MTL and its value isan issue in dispute between Mr. and Ms. Sutton.

[36]

Mr. Sutton states that he and Ms. Sutton and their company were sued for

between $250,000 and $300,000 in various lawsuits, including an action by BMO
for $100,000 on their mortgage on the Miller Lake cottage. He says that theseactions “were all settled at a lower amount and paid into court.”

He says that

from 2015, when he secured his employment in Nunavut, until March 2016, heused 67% of his gross pay and an inheritance he received from his family to paypersonal debts totaling $50,779. He says that the debt has all been re-paid, withthe exception of the mortgage judgment, which amounts to approximately
$221,000, including $150,000 owed to the property management company theBank hired when it took possession of the property.

[37]

Mr. Sutton says that he is repaying the mortgage judgment at the rate of

$2,500 every two weeks, and says that he hopes to negotiate reduced payments.
He says that the company still owns the lot which the Suttons purchased as aplace to store the company’s equipment, and that Mr. and Ms. Sutton each haveshareholder loans owing to them by the company.

[38]

Ms. Sutton disputes Mr. Sutton’s assertions regarding their debts, the

litigation, and the terms of settlement that he says he negotiated, and shedemands proof.

History of the proceedingMr. Sutton began the present proceeding by an Application issued on April

23, 2015, in which he claimed a divorce, spousal support for himself, based onthe fact that he had earned no income from 2010 to 2014, and an unequaldivision of net family property, including Ms. Sutton’s teacher’s pension. Heclaimed that from 2012 to 2014, he had lived on his savings and an inheritance.

[40]

Ms. Sutton notes that Mr. Sutton apparently never received Ontario Works,

ODSP, or CPP disability, and that he offers no explanation for why he did notearn income from the business he operated nor why, if the business was notgenerating income, he did not seek employment elsewhere. She further notesthat Mr. Sutton secured his four year employment contract in Nunavut at aboutthe time he commenced the present proceeding, and that, as a result of thatemployment, he earns over three times the income that Ms. Sutton receives fromher pension and Government benefits.

[41]

The Application was served on Ms. Sutton on July 26, 2015, in Woodstock,

Ontario.

On November 6, 2015, Ms. Sutton delivered her Answer, in which she

claims spousal support and unequal division of net family property, and makes arequest for financial disclosure. Mr. Sutton delivered his Reply on November 25,2015, and a Case Conference was held on that date by Thompson J.

[42]

On September 22, 2016, Ms. Sutton moved for temporary spousal support,

including retroactive support, and for financial disclosure. The parties exchangednumerous affidavits and the motion was heard on September 26 and October 31,2016, judgment being reserved until today.

ISSUES

[43]

The court must determine whether, having regard to the means and

the factors to be considered, and the range of spousal support set out in theSpousal Support Advisory Guidelines, Ms. Sutton is entitled to receive interimspousal support from Mr. Sutton.

[44]

Putting the issue differently, the court is asked to determine whether Ms.

Sutton, a 63-year-old spouse whose income in 2015 was $39,142.20, and who,for most of the year, “lives a very simple and modest life in Portugal with her newpartner,” is entitled to receive spousal support from Mr. Sutton, whose income,since 2015, has been over three times hers.

[45]

Mr. Sutton argues, in paragraph 4 of his factum, “…the principles should

not apply, given the fact that the parties separated in October 2010, the motion isbeing heard in September 2016, 6 years post-separation, and there has been nospousal support paid in the meantime.”
PARTIES’ POSITIONS

[46]

Ms. Sutton argues that she is entitled to interim spousal support, based on

her contributions to Mr. Sutton’s businesses and career and the fact that, bycaring for the family’s children and household, she enabled Mr. Sutton to expandhis education, skills and experience. In her affidavit sworn March 4, 2016, shestates:
111. I gave the applicant freedom. I helped free him from the constraintsand obligations of parenting. He could focus on maximizing his businessand career potential. He lived and worked away from the family for considerableperiods during the marriage and even when he was at home, I primarily managedthe children.

circumstances of the parties, the objectives of an interim spousal support order,

Court File No: 5073/15

Reasons For Order - Price J.

112. The Applicant chose not to responsibly grow and build his business(es)
and career but rather to alienate colleagues, partners, and customers. He choseself-employment as “his own boss”, in service of his need to be independent, buthe was temperamentally unsuited for self-employment. He cut corners in hisbusiness life. He had problems with customers. He repeatedly incurred debt,often by unnecessary purchases both personally and in his business life. He livedbeyond his means, to the point where he repeatedly filed for bankruptcy and thefamily was compromised by his financial irresponsibility and imprudence.
113. I not only primarily managed the family at home, but workedsummers while I was teaching to make extra money for the family. I
contributed money from my employment to assist the Applicant in hisbusiness ventures. Members of my family assisted the Suttons financially invarious ways. I assisted the Applicant in acquiring his MBA. [Emphasisadded]

[47]

Ms. Sutton additionally bases her entitlement to spousal support on her

financial need and Mr. Sutton’s ability to pay.

[48]

Mr. Sutton argues that Ms. Sutton is not entitled to interim spousal support

because both parties furthered their educations during the marriage, bothsuffered setbacks, and that his own financial setbacks were contributed to by theunpaid work he performed for Ms. Sutton’s family. He asserts that neither he norMs. Sutton were advantaged or disadvantaged by the marriage, and that bothmaintained their employment during most of the marriage. He further argues thatMs. Sutton has no need for spousal support by reason of the modest lifestyle shehas chosen to have with her current partner in Portugal.

Jurisprudence

[55]

The Supreme Court of Canada, in Moge v. Moge, in 1992, commented on

the purpose of spousal support in relieving economic hardship resulting from themarriage or its breakdown. McLachlan J. stated:
… [T]he judge’s order should…grant relief from any economic hardship arisingfrom the breakdown of the marriage. The focus here, it seems to me, is not oncompensation for what the spouses have contributed to or gained from themarriage. The focus is rather post-marital need; if the breakdown of themarriage has created economic hardship for one or the other, the judgemust attempt to grant relief from that hardship.3 [Emphasis added.]

[56]

The circumstances to be considered

of spousal support,

in relation to need,

when determining the amount

include the spouse’s capacity

to

contribute to her own support, 4 the measures available for her to become able toprovide for her own support, and the length of time and cost entailed for thedependent to take those measures. 5

[57]

The determination of entitlement to spousal support does not involve only

a consideration of needs and means. In determining the appropriate amountof spousal support, compensatory and non-compensatory considerations should3

be taken into account in an effort to equitably

alleviate the economic

consequences of the breakdown of the relationship. 6 Entitlement can be based

Compensatory support

[58]

Because

marriage

is

a

joint

endeavour, spousal

support orders

are

designed to be compensatory, to bring about an equitable sharing of the benefitsand burdens of the relationship, having regard to all the circumstances, includingthe advantages each of the parties derived from their relationship. L’HeureuxDubé, J. stated in Moge:
Essentially, compensatory support intends that both spouses profit from the jointventure of marriage. The question is not what the disadvantaged spouse wouldhave achieved had he or she not entered into the marriage. Rather thequestion is what was that spouse’s contribution to the marriage and wasthe other spouse advantaged by that contribution. If so, does equity demanda sharing of any advantage gained should the benefits of an advantaged spousebe apportioned. In practical terms, the issue will generally revolve aroundwhether one spouse has gained an advantage in his or her ability to earnincome or acquire assets that should be shared for at least some period oftime.8 [Emphasis added.]

Contractual entitlement

[59]

Contractual

entitlement

flows

from

the

agreement between the parties to the marriage. 9 While there was no expressagreement between Mr. and Ms. Sutton regarding spousal support, each had areasonable expectation, based on the long duration of their marriage, that theywould derive an equal benefit from their respective contributions to it.

Non-compensatory support is a residual basis for ordering support “where

it is fit and just to do so.” Non-compensatory support is generally based on the

[61]

In Robertson v. Hotte (1996), MacDougall J. set out a four-step analysis for

determining whether a claimant is entitled to interim spousal support. He stated:
In reviewing the needs of the Applicant, the motions judge was advised thatMs. Hotte was not employed and was receiving government assistance andthat her ability to earn income was limited as she had not been employedoutside the home for a considerable period of time.
The court should not, at an interim application stage, place too muchemphasis on the submission by the payor spouse of the dependantspouse’s failure to pursue self-sufficiency. It is apparent that Ms. Hotte hasan obvious need and her proposed budget is a relatively modest budget. 10

[62]

The test established in Robertson has been followed by

a number of

cases, including by O’Connor J. in Ferreira v. Ferreira (1998),11 and by Platana J.
in Wilson v. Wilson (2002).12

[63]

While self-sufficiency is an objective that must be considered whenever

determining

of

under

the Divorce Act, Ms. Sutton’s failure to achieve self-sufficiency should not begiven much emphasis, especially at this interim stage.

sets out governing interim support motions. These principles can conveniently be

1. Onus and Burden of Proof:
(a) Motions for interim support are summary in nature. The court willgenerally not conduct a detailed investigation into the merits of acase, in large part because at the stage of a motion for interimsupport, there is not sufficient evidence to enable the court to do so.
(b) A claimant need only establish a prima facie case for relief.15
(c) Where contested issues of fact need to be resolved, especially thoseconnected with the threshold issue of entitlement, it becomes lessadvisable to order interim support.
2. Criteria for Entitlement:
(a) The court on an application for interim support should not undulyemphasize any one of the statutory considerations above others;
(b) That being said, the claimant’s needs and the respondent’s ability topay often assume greater significance and the respondent’s need toachieve

self-sufficiency

often

assumes

less

significance

on applications for interim support than they do at trial.
3. Appropriate amount of support:
(a) Interim support order should be sufficient to allow a dependentspouse money to maintain a reasonable lifestyle pending trial.
(b) Interim support should allow the applicant to continue living at thesame standard of living enjoyed prior to separation if the payor’sability to pay warrants it.

responsibility, except during the 7 months when she was at teachers’ college.
This resulted in an advantage to Mr. Sutton, during those years he spent earninghis B.A. and M.B.A., and during the years he spent developing the managerialexperience that likely helped qualify him for his current employment as a propertymanager in Nunavut. Ms. Sutton’s contribution to Mr. Sutton’s career resulted inan occupational disadvantage to her, owing to the interruption of her career whenthe parties moved to British Columbia to facilitate Mr. Sutton’s employment there.

[66]

Ms. Sutton is entitled to compensation for the advantage that Mr. Sutton

derived by being able to return to school and earn his B.A. and M.B.A., and bybeing able to manage his business with Ms. Sutton’s help, and the economicdisadvantage which Ms. Sutton suffered from the marriage, even though theadvantage which Mr. Sutton derived from Ms. Sutton’s efforts is undermined bythe reverses he experienced in his woodworking businesses, and the impact thatthese had on both parties’ assets. It serves little purpose to attribute blame toeither party for those reverses, and s. 15.2(5) of the Divorce Act provides that inmaking an interim support order, the court shall not take into consideration any

Non-compensatory spousal support

[67]

It is not realistic to expect that Ms. Sutton, at the age of 63 and in poor

health, will become financially self-sufficient in the future at a standard of livingapproaching that which the parties enjoyed during the marriage.

I find that Ms.

Sutton’s current need has resulted, in part, from the following facts:
a) Ms. Sutton followed Mr. Sutton to British Columbia because his

employment and her role in the marriage demanded it;b) Ms. Sutton’s role in the marriage impeded her from developing

her own financial self-sufficiency and, in particular, interrupted herpensionable employment;c) Mr. Sutton failed to provide support spousal to Ms. Sutton after

the parties separated;d) Ms. Sutton’s age and medical conditions would prevent her from

securing gainful employment even if she resided in Ontario fulltime.

[68]

Ms. Sutton was financially dependent on Mr. Sutton for most of the parties’

35 year marriage, and her economic well-being reflected the vicissitudes of hisbusiness ventures. The economic disadvantage and hardship that she sufferedas a result of the reverses in his fortunes was made worse by the marriagebreakdown.

Ms. Sutton is 63 years old. She retired from her employment as a teacher

as a result of stress, anxiety and panic attacks. The evidence satisfies me, on a

unable to secure gainful employment.

[70]

The fact that Ms. Sutton’s employer granted her medical leaves of absence

and, ultimately, early retirement, supports a finding that she is, in fact, disabledby the stress, anxiety and panic attacks she says she suffered in the later yearsof her marriage. Ms. Sutton tendered a letter from the Waterloo Catholic DistrictSchool Board dated July 27, 2015, confirming her sick leave from September 27
to October 3, 2010, from March 7 to 20, 2011, from April 11 to 26, 2011, andfrom September to November 13, 2011.

[71]

The evidentiary value of the employer’s determinations regarding Ms.

Sutton’s capacity to work during those leaves of absence and for purposes of herearly retirement are equivalent to those which the court has given in cases wheredeterminations have been made by a pension authority as to a claimant’sdisability.

[72]

Justice Langdon, hearing a motion by a mother to vary her divorce

judgment based on a reduced ability to pay in Salvatore v. Etcovitch-Holley, in2012, found that “the award of the disability pension is prima facie evidence ofdisability, and that I must accept that condition as evidence of Joan’s need.” 17

From my observation of [Ms. Sutton] in this time period her personality hadchanged – she was quiet, timid, worried and obviously stressed. Theaccumulated stress over the years was too much and she could notmanage as a teacher. She had to take early retirement. Even though she lovedteaching her personal life was falling apart.

The Family Law Act sets out, in s. 33(9), factors that the court should

With regard to paragraph 63, I reside in Portugal, but I travel about three to fourtimes per year to Canada. I have a very simple lifestyle, not a “verycomfortable” one.
With regard to the travel to Canada I travel to see some of my grandchildren andfamily. About half of the time my sister Marie Anderson pays for my airplanetickets.

 whether the information comes from an official website from awell-known organization;
 whether the information is capable of being verified;
 whether the source is disclosed so that the objectivity of theperson or organization posting the material can be assessed.

[88]

Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that where the threshold of "admissibility" is

met, it is still up to the trier of fact to weigh and assess the information todetermine what significance, if any, it has on the issues to be decided. The courtconcluded, at para. 27, that the evidence in that case did not meet the thresholdof admissibility and that it should be struck:
Accordingly, I find that affidavit evidence, "on information and belief",including information taken from the internet, is potentially admissible ininterlocutory applications, such as a class action certification application, andmay be admitted "under special circumstances" where the "grounds forsuch information and belief" are adequately disclosed and the informationis reliable. Here, the subjective basis for the reliability of the information has notbeen disclosed and, furthermore, there is no objective basis to believe that thevarious postings have any degree of reliability.

Based on the factors set out in section 33(9), above, I consider the

Of this amount, $889.20 per month, or $10,670.40 on an annual basis, consistedof non-recurrent withdrawals from an R.R.S.P. I do not include these withdrawalsin income, based on the analysis I gave in McConnell v. McConnell (2015), whichI adopt for purposes of these reasons. 32 Accordingly, I find that his base income,including allowances, with the exception of the Northern Residents Allowance,was $125,480.64.

In addition, Mr. Sutton acknowledges that he receives the following

I have considered whether Mr. Sutton’s living allowance and Northern

conclude that they should be included, with the exception of $1,000 of hisNorthern resident deduction; although some adjustment is required to reflect the

and travel

The B.C. Supreme Court, in Webster v.

Webster (2014), reviewed these decisions and set out the principles derived fromthem as follows:
I take the following principles from the authorities:
a) generally, a living-out allowance paid for the recovery of workrelated travel and living expenses will not be treated as incomeunder the Guidelines;b) living-out allowances are intended to compensate the recipientspouse for the extra costs associated with working away fromhome;c) In all the cases where courts have excluded living-outallowances from the recipient spouse's Guideline income, therehas been some evidence that the recipient actually incurred extracosts associated with working away from home, although therecipient was not required to account for the whole amount of theallowance; andd) under s. 19(1) of the Guidelines, the court has a broad discretionto impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considersappropriate in the circumstances.
The circumstances in which the court may impute income to a spouse specificallyenumerated in s. 19 of the Guidelines are non-exhaustive: Nielsen v.

[100] The court includes in the payor spouse’s income, for support purposes,that portion of a “living allowance” or “relocation allowance” that exceeds actual33

expenses incurred. 35 In the case of a non-taxable allowance, the court maydecline to gross-up that portion of the amount received which reflected actualWein J., in Scurci v. Scurci, (2013),

stated:
In most cases dealing with the issue of grossing up of income on the basis of anon-taxable allowance, the issue has been determined at trial. In thosecircumstances, more information is available concerning the actual use of theallowance money so that the added benefit if any can be determined. In mostcases, the money is a reimbursement for actual costs such as themaintenance of a second home close to work, a living allowance for moreexpensive costs of living in a particular area, or an offset of extra drivingrequired to return home. In some cases, the legitimate additional expenseswere determined to be recovered by not grossing up the pay for incometaxes. The cases have been recently reviewed in the decision in Arnott v.

[101] Mr. Sutton, in his Financial Statement sworn August 4, 2016, states thathe receives a rent subsidy of $1,068 per year.

He states that his rent, “net of

subsidy in addition to northern allowance,” is $666 per month and that he incurs
$419.10 additional housing expenses, as follows:
$28.50 for electricity
$59.12 for telephone

[102] The

enumerated

expenses

are

equivalent

to

the

monthly

housing

expenses I would expect for an individual residing in southwestern Ontario. I amhowever, include the employer’s matching contribution of $7,907.76 to Mr.Sutton’s pension. This increases his income to $133,388.40. I deduct from histotal income the amount of $300 per month, or $3,600 on an annual basis, whichMr. Sutton reports as an expense for airline travel to Nunavut. I make nodeduction for a premium on the cost of groceries, which Mr. Sutton reports at
$1,331 per month, as he has not provided the particulars of how this amount isderived or what portion of it represents the cost of groceries which he shares withMs. Rutter. Deducting the $3,600 from his total income of $133,388.40, I imputean annual income of $129,788.40 to Mr. Sutton.

[103] Based on Mr. Sutton’s income of $129,788.40 and Ms. Sutton’s income of
$39,142, the range of spousal support suggested by the Spousal SupportAdvisory Guidelines is from $2,833 to $3,728, with a mid-point of $3,305 permonth.

[104] L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated in Moge: “The longer the relationship endures,the closer the economic union, the greater will be the presumptive claimto equal standards of

living upon its dissolution.” 37

Although spousal support,

which focuses on equitable sharing, does not guarantee to either party thestandard of living enjoyed during the marriage, this standard is still relevant tosupport entitlement. 38 Furthermore, great disparities that would result in thespouses’ respective standards of living in the absence of support are often arevealing indication of the economic disadvantages inherent in the role that oneof the parties assumed during the marriage.
37

Such a disparity has resulted

between the incomes of Mr. and Ms. Sutton following their separation. Based onthe parties’ long-term marriage, the primary responsibility Ms. Sutton assumed

assets which the parties were left with at the end of their marriage, I find thatsupport at the upper end of the range is appropriate. Mr. Sutton will therefore berequired to pay spousal support to Ms. Sutton in the amount of $3,728 permonth.
Claim for retroactive spousal support

[105] In Kerr v. Baranow (2011), the Supreme Court emphasized that whenconsidering the factors relevant to determinations of support when support issought in relation to a period predating the court order, the exercise of judicialdiscretion requires flexibility and a holistic view of each case on its merits. 39

[106] As with retroactive child support, other relevant considerations include theconduct of the payor, the reason for the delay in seeking support on the part ofthe recipient spouse and any hardship on the payor spouse occasioned by theaward. In Reis v. Bucholtz (2010), the B.C. Court of Appeal considered theprinciples and analysis in D.B.S. v. S.R.G. (2006) with respect to retroactive childsupport that are applicable to claims for retroactive spousal support. 40 Thefactors to consider are:

40

1.

Reasonable excuse for why support was not soughtearlier;

2.

Conduct of the payor;

3.

Circumstances of the child; and

4.

Hardship occasioned by a retroactive award.

[107] In the present case, it is appropriate to begin the period of interim spousalsupport on October 1, 2015, when Ms. Sutton delivered her Answer, in which sheMr. Sutton secured his current

employment in April 2015, and was capable of providing spousal support fromMay onward. He was aware of her claim on October 1, 2015.

[108] The conflicting affidavits, Mr. Sutton’s late financial disclosure, and theparties’ failure to cross-examine each other on their affidavits, leave the courtwith an inadequate evidentiary record on which to base an order for spousalsupport pre-dating the delivery of Ms. Sutton’s Answer.
Mr. Sutton’s proposal to that his debt re-payments be deducted fromsupport

[109] The court has, in appropriate circumstances, lessened a payor spouse’sspousal support payments where his ability to pay has been diminished by hisassumption of the parties’ joint debt obligations. Justice Hennessy made such areduction in Stafford v. Stafford (2013), on the ground of undue hardship, wherethe payor spouse had made a consumer proposal and the court ordered him topay retroactive support. Justice Gordon later restored the recipient spouse’ssupport after the joint debts had been paid. He stated:
The Respondent is of the view that his assumption of the joint marital debtalleviates his obligation to pay spousal support. He says the Applicant forfeitedher entitlement to support when the temporary order of Justice Hennessy wasmade allowing him to make payment of the joint debts in lieu of spousal support.
I disagree. The order of Justice Hennessy, made on a temporary basis to reflectthe situation of the parties at that time, recognized that the Respondent’s abilityto pay spousal support was lessened as a result of his assumption of the jointdebts. Once those debts were retired, or in the event the Respondentreceived an asset of corresponding value to offset those debts, spousalsupport would be at issue once again.

[110] In Wilson v. Bedard (2016), Henderson J. declined to reduce the recipientspouse’s interim spousal support by a portion of the interest payments beingmade by the payor spouse. Justice Henderson stated:
With respect to the debt payment, the respondent cited two cases of Dunn v.
Dunn, 2014 ONSC 7277 and Sartain v. McCabe, 2015 ONSC 2198. Both aredistinguishable in that they are final decisions after the court has been able todetermine all the facts after a full trial.
Section 12.2 of the SSAG discourages the deduction of debt paymentsfrom spousal support awards. The debt is usually associated with anasset. Where assets exceed debt, generally there is no hardship visitedupon the payer of the debt.
The applicant urged me, and I accept, that it is best to address debtpayments in the context of a final solution….43 [Emphasis added.]

[111] In Monger v. Monger (1994), Cusinato J. declined to make an order at trialdirecting that a portion of spousal support be applied toward reduction of theparties’ joint debt. In coming to this decision, Cusinato J. noted that Kennedy J.
and Higgins J. had made interim orders directing that a portion of interim spousalsupport be applied in reduction of the parties’ joint obligations. Justice Cusinatothen continued, stating:
The intent of each of these previous orders was to provide that the paymentswhich were redirected from support in reduction of family debts incurred prior toseparation were nonetheless to be considered support. It was believed thesecould be deducted by the defendant pursuant to s. 56.1 and 60.1 of theIncome Tax Act of Canada. Unfortunately, this was not to transpire. TheDepartment of National Revenue at present has refused to recognize anydebt repayment as support.

Stafford v. Stafford, 2013 ONSC 2393, at paras. 16 and 17.
Wilson v. Bedard, 2016 ONSC 2653, at paras. 29-30.

Both of those events have taken place. The joint debts from the marriage are nolonger outstanding, and the Respondent will retain a portion of the Applicant’sentitlement to his pension sufficient to offset the debt he assumed. It would bepatently unfair to deprive her of support in these circumstances.42

If reassessment occurs, this will have a bearing on the available cash flowto the defendant at some time in the future. While Mr. Hainsworth, for thedefence, has suggested that this probability should have a direct effect on myconsideration of spousal support, I conclude it is premature to direct my mindto those considerations when the exact consequences are unknown.44

[112] Mr. Sutton’s incomplete disclosure, combined with his assertion, in hisaffidavit, that that he was in the process of negotiating a reduction of his debtpayments, leaves me in some doubt as to the extent of the debt and of Mr.Sutton’s ongoing debt repayments. Additionally, there is no evidence before meas to the potential tax consequences of an order reducing interim support by aportion of the debt repayments that Mr. Sutton is making. In these circumstances,it is appropriate to defer a determination as to whether there should be a set-offof Ms. Sutton’s obligation in relation to the debt repayments against Mr. Sutton’sobligation to pay her spousal support until more complete disclosure is provided.
c)

What further financial disclosure should Mr. Sutton be requiredto provide at this time?

[113] Ms. Sutton claimed additional financial support from Mr. Sutton in herNotice of Motion, served on June 1, 2016.

Mr. Sutton produced some of the

financial disclosure requested in his affidavit sworn July 29, 2016 and in hisFinancial Statement sworn August 4, 2016.

[114] Mr. Sutton is required to produce the records relating to the debts heclaims in his Financial Statement. At page 5 of the Financial Statement, Mr.Sutton sets out his debt, including a judgment on the Miller Lake cottage. Heseeks an equalization payment based on Ms. Sutton’s assets, principally herpension, and it is in his interest to value the cottage property at a high amount.
44

With the tax authorities taking a different view as to the defendants’
spousal support deductions, without an appeal to such ruling, this maycreate a reassessment for the husband.

He attributes a value of $262,500 to his 50% interest in the cottage, and hasproduced an appraisal of the property by the Municipal Property Assessment

property, as the value he asserts does not correspond to the MPAC assessment.

[115] In Mr. Sutton’s affidavit sworn July 29, 2016, he discusses the Bank’senforcement of its remedies under the mortgage on the Miller Lake property. Heattaches a prospective agreement on an interest rate, one of the conditions ofwhich was that he obtain an appraisal. Ms. Sutton is asking whether such anappraisal was ever obtained. She is entitled to an unequivocal answer to thatquestion.

[116] Mr. Sutton has disclosed that the Bank obtained a writ of possession forthe Miller Lake property in 2013. It was Mr. Sutton who dealt with the Bank in itsaction on the mortgage. Ms. Sutton seeks the records in relation to the Bank’ssale of the property, and is entitled to those records to the extent that Mr. Suttonis in possession, power or control of them, or an explanation if he once was, butno longer is in possession of them.

[117] Ms. Sutton requires the records substantiating the debts that Mr. Suttonclaims existed on the date of separation, and substantiating the payment of them.
Mr. Sutton has not produced these records. In his Financial Statement, forexample, he has claimed a debt in the amount of $5,308 to Home Depot on thedate of separation. At tab 16 of his Disclosure brief, he provides only three postseparation receipts from Home Depot from 2011. Similarly, the invoice heproduced from Sparling Propane is from March 2013. Many of the receipts heproduced for Peninsula Timber Mart are also from after the date of separation,and do not substantiate the amount claimed as a personal debt of Mr. Sutton.

Sutton. If he is unable to obtain them, he must provide information thatsubstantiates that he made his best effort to obtain them, and must account forhow he arrived at the amounts he claims for the debts on the date of separation.

[119] Mr. Sutton claims a debt to the Portuguese Club and produced and invoicedated August 28, 2010, in the amount of $17,512.74. He later stated that hereimbursed his daughter this amount in accordance with an agreement theparties had made to do so. He has not documented this agreement, or providedparticulars of it, nor produced evidence that the parties’ daughter paid theinvoice, or that he reimbursed her. This further disclosure is required.

[120] Mr. Sutton must provide documentation for the corporate assets and debtsof MTL Contracting Inc., for the valuation of the business, and for the building lotthat the parties purchased and how that lot has been accounted for in thevaluation of the business. Mr. Sutton states, at paragraph 49 of his affidavit, thathe is in possession of the corporate bank statements from October 1, 2009,which are voluminous, and that Ms. Sutton can attend in Nunavut to inspectthem. This is not a satisfactory response to Ms. Sutton’s request. He mustproduce these records to Ms. Sutton’s lawyer in the customary manner.

What costs are payable

Without the benefit of argument on costs, but based on the fact that at the

hearing, Ms. Sutton stated that her costs of the motion had been $7,500 on a fullindemnity scale, with a minimal amount for disbursements, and the fact that shehas been substantially successful in her motion, I would be inclined to fix hercosts at $4,500 (60%) on a partial indemnity scale, plus H.S.T.
