The applicant wife brought a motion to strike the respondent husband's pleadingsbecause he had failed to comply with various court orders and had failed to make fulldisclosure.

Although the respondent's pleadings were not struck, various orders weremade.

Among them, the respondent was required to sign authorizations directing variousfinancial institutions to provide information to the applicant, and directing a real estateagent and lawyer to provide information regarding the respondent's offer to purchase ahouse at a time when he stated he had no money and could barely make ends meet.

Therespondent was unsuccessful on his motion to adjourn the applicant's motion for thepurposes of questioning.

In paragraph 11 of my endorsement dated November 24, 2016,I found that the respondent's motion was a last minute attempt to delay the applicant'smotion.

The applicant requests fees of $16,748 and disbursements of $373.55.

The respondent is prohibited from bringing any further proceedings until this amount ispaid.
