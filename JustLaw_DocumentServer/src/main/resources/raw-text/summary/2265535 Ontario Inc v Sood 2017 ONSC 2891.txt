The Respondents submit that: a) they had fully complied with the February 12, 2016 Order and produced all theRecords;b) alternatively, the Respondents submit they acted in good faith and made bestefforts to produce all the Records in accordance with the February 12, 2016 Order;c) in the further alternative, the Respondents submit that the contempt motion wouldnot have succeeded because the Applicants had brought the Application in bad 4 faith and sought the Records for the purpose of assisting a competitor who wantedto buy the Various Businesses the motion for leave to commence a derivative action was to be adjourned.

THE ANALYSIS Determining whether the Respondents are in contempt is not necessary The thrust of much of the Respondents' submissions is that the Respondents were concerned the Applicants had brought this Application for the purpose of forcing theRespondents to sell the Various Businesses and that the Records would be disclosed to the Respondents did not want to sell).

Had the Respondents produced all the Records prior to the Applicant's contempt motion? Having reviewed the voluminous materials filed by both parties, I am satisfied that the Respondents had not produced all the Records by the date the Applicants brought the contemptmotion.
