The landlord now seeks costs for the partialsummary judgment.

The landlord submitted a costs outline claiming $8,742.

The costs outlineadvanced a claim for the partial summary judgment motion and for 25% of the time spent onpleadings, productions and discoveries.

The landlord submitted that it was reasonable to assumethat 25% of the time spent on those steps was related to the issues raised on the summaryjudgment motion.

The tenant submitted that the amount claimed for costs was excessive and that theappropriate award is $4,500, all inclusive, which award would be just the costs of the partialsummary judgment motion.

I agree with the tenant that the costs should be just of the motion, with the costs for thetime spent on pleadings, productions, and discoveries all remaining to be determined in thecause.

I also agree with the tenant that the quantum of costs should be $4,500 all inclusive.
