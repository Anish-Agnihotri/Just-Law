The Plaintiffs' Claim and the Defendants' Counter-claim arise as a result of a failedbusiness relationship between the Ussia Family and the defendant AlexSivitilli.

The Defendants submit that the matters for which they seek to file further evidence werenot raised on cross-examination but rather were contained in the affidavit of Mr. Marchioni filedby the Plaintiffs in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment and by the Defendants in theSupplementary Affidavit of Mr. Sivitilli delivered November 18, 2016.

The Plaintiffs deny the Defendants' submission and assert that the Defendants did notallude to the tolling issues until Mr. Sivitilli mentioned them following cross-examination at theprompting of his counsel on re-examination and did not allude to the s. 11 issues until followingthe completion of the cross-examination.
