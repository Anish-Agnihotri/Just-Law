These include: On January 30, 2014, the Landlord applied to the Alcohol and GamingCommission of Ontario to have Baffo's liquor licence transferred to the Landlord, and itwas transferred to the Landlord on March 14, 2014. In Hodgkinson v. Rodd, Ferguson J. awarded punitive damages against a landlord, takinginto consideration the landlord's inconsistent exercise of both forfeiture and distress and the factthat the landlord had, by its conduct, prejudiced the tenant's ability to prove his damages.<a href="../page 3/page3_4.html">Read More</a>

														As a result, they seek an order rescinding or staying the operation of the ConditionalFoundation Building Permit issued by the city "Until compliance with applicable law isestablished for the exterior wall of the proposed building." The Evidence The applicants rely on two affidavits sworn by Dan Dencev, the property manager oftheir building. The City's position can be summarized as follows: the application is moot because the City has now issued a building permitfor the project and no appeal has been taken from that action; site plan approval is a prerequisite for the issuance of a building permitunder s. 8(2) of the Building Code Act but is not for a conditional permitissued under s. 8(3); the applicants received notice of the proposed rezoning of 356 DundasStreet and made no appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board, which is theappropriate appeal route; and in any event, the zero metre setback pre-existed rezoning and is theexisting setback for all properties located in the Downtown Area zone in the City, which includes these two properties. The chief building official shall issue a permit referred to in subsection unless, the proposed building, construction or demolition will contravenethis Act, the building code or any other applicable law 1 Even though all requirements have not been met to obtain a permit undersubsection, the chief building official may issue a conditional permit forany stage of construction if, 1 Subsections to are not included here because none apply.<a href="../page 3/page3_5.html">Read More</a>
