				Pet Valu Canada Inc., <mark>stopped paying rent </mark>and vacatedits premises in a plaza. The landlord, 7Marli Limited, did not re-enter

				some of that unpaid rent. I granted a partial summary judgment for $101,209.16. See 7MarliLimited v. Pet Valu Canada
				Inc., 2017 ONSC 1796. The landlord now seeks costs for the partialsummary judgment. [2] The landlord submitted a costs
				outline claiming $8,742.91, all inclusive. The costs outlineadvanced a claim for the partial summary judgment motion
				and for 25% of the time spent onpleadings, productions and discoveries. The landlord submitted that it was reasonable
				to assumethat 25% of the time spent on those steps was related to the issues raised on the summaryjudgment motion. [3]
				The tenant submitted that the amount claimed for costs was excessive and that theappropriate award is $4,500, all inclusive,
				which award would be just the <mark>costs of the partial summary</mark> judgment motion. [4] I agree with the tenant that the costs
				should be just of the motion, with the costs for thetime spent on pleadings, productions, and discoveries all remaining
				to be determined in thecause. I also agree with the tenant that the quantum of costs should be $4,500 all inclusive.
				Orderaccordingly. ___________________ Perell, J. Released: May 11, 2017 CITATION: 7Marli Limited v. Pet Valu Canada Inc.,
